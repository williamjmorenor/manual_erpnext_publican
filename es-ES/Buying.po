msgstr ""

msgid "If your business involves physical goods, buying is one of your core business activity. Your suppliers are as important as your customers and they must be provided with as much accurate information as possible.

msgstr ""

msgid "Audit whether all Suppliers were given the opportunity to quote."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\n"
"		Buying &gt; Documents &gt; Purchase Order &gt; New Purchase Order\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "Supplier."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Value Added Taxes (VAT)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Many a times, the tax paid by you to a Supplier, for an Item, is the same tax which you collect from your Customer. In many regions, what you pay to your government is only the difference between what you collect from your Customer and what you pay to your Supplier. This is called Value Added Tax (VAT)."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example you buy Items worth X and sell them for 1.3X. So your Customer pays 1.3 times the tax you pay your Supplier. Since you have already paid tax to your Supplier for X, what you owe your government is only the tax on 0.3X."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is very easy to track in ERPNext since each tax head is also an Account. Ideally you must create two Accounts for each type of VAT you pay and collect, “Purchase VAT-X” (asset) and “Sales VAT-X” (liability), or something to that effect."
msgstr ""

msgid "Purchase UOM and Stock UOM Conversion"
msgstr ""
