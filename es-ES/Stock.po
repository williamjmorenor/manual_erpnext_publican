msgid "Stock"
msgstr ""

msgid "For most small business that deal in physical goods, a large part of their net worth is invested in the stock in hand."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are three main types of entries:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Purchase Receipt: Items received from Suppliers against Purchase Orders."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stock Entry: Items transferred from one Warehouse to another."
msgstr ""

msgid "Delivery Note: Items shipped to Customers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tracking stock is not just about adding and subtracting quantities. Some complications arise when:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Back-dated (past) entries are made / edited: This affects future stock levels and may lead to negative stock."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stock has to be valued based on First-in-First-out: ERPNext needs to maintain a sequence of all transactions to know the exact value of your Items."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stock reports are required at any point in time in the past: You have to lookup what was the quantity / value your stock of Item X on date Y."
msgstr ""

msgid "To manage this, ERPNext collects all inventory transactions in a table called the Stock Ledger Entry. All Purchase Receipts, Stock Entries and Delivery Notes update this table."
msgstr ""

msgid "Item Master"
msgstr ""

msgid "An Item is your companys' product or a service. The term Item is applicable to your core products as well as your raw materials. It can be a product or service that you buy/sell from your customers/ suppliers. ERPNext allows you to manage all sorts of items like raw-materials, sub-assemblies, finished goods, item variants and service items."
msgstr ""

msgid "ERPNext is optimized for itemized management of your sales and purchase. If you are in services, you can create an Item for each services that your offer. Completing the Item Master is very essential for successful implementation of ERPNext."
msgstr ""

msgid "Item Codification"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you already have a full-fledged business with a number of physical items, you would have probably coded your items. If you have not, you have a choice. We recommend that you should codify if you have lot of products with long or complicated names. In case you have few products with short names, it is preferable to keep the Item Code same as Item Name."
msgstr ""

msgid "Item codification has been a sensitive topic and wars have been fought on this (not joking). In our experience, when you have items that cross a certain size, life without codification is a nightmare."
msgstr ""

msgid "Benefits of Item Codification:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Standard way of naming things."
msgstr ""

msgid "Less likely to have duplicates."
msgstr ""

msgid "Explicit definition."
msgstr ""

msgid "Helps to quickly find if a similar item exists."
msgstr ""

msgid "Item names get longer and longer as more types get introduced. Codes are shorter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Disadvantages of Item Codification:"
msgstr ""

msgid "You have to remember the codes!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Harder for new team members to pick up."
msgstr ""

msgid "You have to create new codes all the time."
msgstr ""

msgid "You should have a simple manual / cheat-sheet to codify your Items instead of just numbering them sequentially. Each letter should mean something."
msgstr ""

msgid "Standardization: If you have more than one person naming items, the style of naming items will change for everyone. Sometimes, even for one person, he or she may forget how they had named the item and may create a duplicate name \"Wooden Sheet 3mm\" or \"3mm Sheet of Wood\"?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Rationalizing: It is a good practice to have minimum varieties of items so that you keep minimum stock, housekeeping is simpler etc. When you are planning a new product and you want to know if you are already purchasing a part in some other product, the item codes will help you quickly determine if you are using a similar raw material in another product."
msgstr ""

msgid "We believe if you do this small investment, it will help you rationalize things as your business grows, though its okay not to codify if you have less items."
msgstr ""

msgid "Item Valuation FIFO and Moving Average"

msgid "Warehouse"
msgstr ""

msgid "A warehouse is a commercial building for storage of goods. Warehouses are used by manufacturers, importers, exporters, wholesalers, transport businesses, customs, etc. They are usually large plain buildings in industrial areas of cities, towns, and villages. They mostly have loading docks to load and unload goods from trucks."
msgstr ""

msgid "To go to Warehouse, click on Stock and go to Warehouse under Masters. You could also go to the Setup module and click on Warehouse under Master Data."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stock &gt; Warehouse &gt; New Warehouse\n"
"	"
msgstr ""

msgid "In ERPNext, every Warehouse must belong to a specific company, to maintain company wise stock balance. The Warehouses are saved with their respective company’s abbreviations. This facilitates in identifying which Warehouse belongs to which company, at a glance."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can include user restrictions for these Warehouses. In case you do not wish a particular user to operate on a particular Warehouse, you can refrain the user from accessing that Warehouse."
msgstr ""

msgid "Merge Warehouse"
msgstr ""

msgid "In day to day transactions, duplicate entries are done by mistake, resulting in duplicate Warehouses. Duplicate records can be merged into a single Warehouse. From the top bar of the system select the File menu. Select Rename and Enter the correct Warehouse and check the Merge button. The system will replace all the links of wrong Warehouse with the correct Warehouse, in all transactions. Also, the available quantity (actual qty, reserved qty, ordered qty etc) of all items in the duplicate warehouse will be transferred to the correct warehouse. Once merging is done, delete the duplicate Warehouse."
msgstr ""

msgid "ERPNext system maintains stock balance for every distinct combination of Item and Warehouse. Thus you can get stock balance for any specific Item in a particular Warehouse on any particular date."
msgstr ""

msgid "Item Group"
msgstr ""

msgid "Item Group is the classification category. Depending on the type of product, categorise it under its respective field. If the product is service oriented, name it under the group head - service. If the product is used as a raw-material, you have to name it under the Raw-material category. In case, your product is used only in trading, you can categorise it under Trading."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can also create your own Item groups ."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stock &gt; Item Group\n"
"	"
msgstr ""

msgid "Serialized Inventory"
msgstr ""

msgid "As we discussed in the Item section, if an Item is serialized, a Serial Number (Serial No) record is maintained for each quantity of that Item. This information is helpful in tracking the location of the Serial No, its warranty and end-of-life (expiry) information."
msgstr ""

msgid "Serial Nos are also useful to maintain fixed assets. Maintenance Schedules can also be created against serial numbers for planning and scheduling maintenance activity for these assets (if they require maintenance)."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can also track from which Supplier you purchased the Serial No and to which Customer you have sold it. The Serial No status will tell you its current inventory status."
msgstr ""

msgid "If your Item is serialized you will have to enter the Serial Nos in the related column with each Serial No in a new line."
msgstr ""

msgid "Serial Nos and Inventory"
msgstr ""

msgid "Inventory of an Item can only be affected if the Serial No is transacted via a Stock transaction (Stock Entry, Purchase Receipt, Delivery Note, Sales Invoice). When a new Serial No is created directly, its warehouse cannot be set."
msgstr ""

msgid "Automatic Series"
msgstr ""

msgid "Serial Nos can automatically be created from a Stock Entry or Purchase Receipt. If you mention Serial No in the Serial Nos column, it will automatically create those serial Nos. If in the Item Master, the Serial No Series is mentioned, you can leave the Serial No column blank in a Stock Entry / Purchase Receipt and Serial Nos will automatically be set from that series."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using Serial Numbers for Multiple Purposes"
msgstr ""

msgid "Serial Nos are a useful tool for tracking different kinds of Items, by using it along with Custom Fields. For example, in our internal system at Frappe, each ERP account is a Serial No, with type of user “Plan” as the Item, its expiry date, whether it is Trial or Paid and other details as Custom Fields."
msgstr ""

msgid "We have known customers who use Serial Nos to track fixed assets, real-estate properties or advertisement slots, even library books!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Since Serial Nos are deeply linked with all the core modules, Selling, Buying, Inventory and Accounting, you may find many uses for them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Batchwise Inventory"
msgstr ""

msgid "Batch inventory feature in ERPNext allows you to group multiple units of an item, and assign them a unique value/number/tag called Batch No."
msgstr ""

msgid "The practise of stocking based on batch is mainly followed in the pharmaceutical industry. Medicines/drugs produced in a particular batched is assigned a unique id. This helps them updating and tracking manufacturing and expiry date for all the units produced under specific batch."
msgstr ""

msgid "To set item as a batch item, \"Has Batch No\" field should be updated as Yes in the Item master."
msgstr ""

msgid "On every stock transaction (Purchase Receipt, Delivery Note, POS Invoice) made for batch item, you should provider item's Batch No. To create new Batch No. master for an item, go to:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Stock &gt; Setup &gt; Batch &gt; New\n"
"	"
msgstr ""

msgid "Batch master is created before creation of Purchase Receipt. Hence eveytime their is Purchase Receipt or Production entry being made for a batch item, you will first create its Batch No, and then select it in Purcase order or Production Entry."
msgstr ""

msgid "Following are the steps to create Batch ID:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Step 1: Enter Batch No and Item Code: Batch No will be defined based on value entered in Batch ID."
msgstr ""

msgid "Step 2: Enter Description and Dates: In stock transactions, Batch IDs will be filtered based on Item Code, Warehouse, Batch Expiry Date (compared with Posting date of a transaction) and Actual Qty in Warehouse. While searching for Batch ID without value in Warehouse field, then Actual Qty filter won't be applied."
msgstr ""

msgid "In stock transactions, Batch IDs will be filtered based on Item Code, Warehouse, Batch Expiry Date (compared with Posting date of a transaction) and Actual Qty in Warehouse. While searching for Batch ID without value in Warehouse field, then Actual Qty filter won't be applied."
msgstr ""

msgid "Purchase Receipt"
msgstr ""

msgid "Purchase Receipts are made when you accept material from your Supplier usually against a Purchase Order. You can also accept Purchase Receipts directly ( Set Purchase Order Required as “No” in Global Defaults)."

msgstr ""

msgid "Rejections"
msgstr ""

msgid "In the Purchase Receipt, you are required to enter whether all the materials you receive are of acceptable quality (in case you check). If you have any rejections, update the “Rejected Quantity” column in the Items table. If you reject, you are required to enter a “Rejected Warehouse” to indicate where you are storing the rejected Items."
msgstr ""

msgid "Quality Inspections"
msgstr ""

msgid "If for certain Items, it is mandatory to record Quality Inspections (if you have set it in your Item master), you will need to update the “Quality Inspection No” (QA No) column. The system will only allow you to “Submit” the Purchase Receipt if you update the “Quality Inspection No”."
msgstr ""

msgid "UOM Conversions"
msgstr ""

msgid "If your Purchase Order for an Item is in a different Unit of Measure (UOM) than what you stock (Stock UOM), then you will need to update the “UOM Conversion Factor”."
msgstr ""

msgid "Currency Conversions"
msgstr ""

msgid "Since the incoming Item affects the value of your inventory, it is important to convert it into your base Currency, if you have ordered in another Currency. You will need to update the Currency Conversion Rate if applicable."
msgstr ""

msgid "Taxes and Valuation"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some of your taxes and charges may affect your Items value. For example, a Tax may not be added to your Item’s valuation, because if you sell the Item, you will have to add the tax at that time. So make sure to mark all your taxes in the Taxes and Charges table correctly for accurate valuation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Serial Numbers and Batches"
msgstr ""

msgid "If your Item is serialized or batched, you will have to enter Serial Number and Batch in the Item's table. You are allowed to enter multiple Serial Numbers in one row (each on a separate line) and you must enter the same number of Serial Numbers as the quantity. You must enter each Batch number on a separate line."
msgstr ""

msgid "What happens when the Purchase Receipt is “Submitted”?"
msgstr ""

msgid "A Stock Ledger Entry is created for each Item adding the Item in the Warehouse by the “Accepted Quantity” If you have rejections, a Stock Ledger Entry is made for each Rejection. The “Pending Quantity” is updated in the Purchase Order."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding value to your Items post Purchase Receipt:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some times, certain expenses that add value to your purchased Items are known only after a while. Common example is, if you are importing the Items, you will come to know of Customs Duty etc only when your “Clearing Agent” sends you a bill. If you want to attribute this cost to your purchased Items, you will have to use the Landed Cost Wizard. Why “Landed Cost”? Because it represents the charges that you paid when it landed in your possession."
msgstr ""

msgid "Delivery Note"
msgstr ""

msgid "A Delivery Note is made when a shipment is shipped from the company’s Warehouse. A copy of the Delivery Note is usually sent with the transporter. The Delivery Note contains the list of Items that are sent in the shipment and updates the inventory. The entry of the Delivery Note is very similar to a Purchase Receipt. You can create a new Delivery Note from:"

msgid "Perpetual Inventory totally depends upon the item valuation rate. Hence, you have to be more careful entering valuation rate while making any incoming stock transactions like Purchase Receipt, Material Receipt, or Manufacturing / Repack."
msgstr ""

msgid "In perpetual inventory, system creates accounting entries for each stock transactions, so that stock and account balance will always remain same. The account balance will be posted against their respective account heads for each Warehouse.

If positive, this value is removed from expenses (cost-of-goods-sold) and is added to assets (stock-in-hand / fixed-assets). If negative, a reverse entry is passed.

But you should also consider shipping cost while buying from that store. Total cost including transportation might be more than the price you get in your nearby store. In that case you will choose to buy from your nearest store, as landed cost of the item is cheaper in the nearest store."

Your transporter can send the invoice after 1 month, but there is no point in waiting for booking Purchase Receipt till then. Companies who imports their products / parts, pays a huge amount as Customs Duty. And generally they get invoices from Customs Department after a period of time. In these cases, “Landed Cost Voucher” becomes handy, as it allows you to add those additional charges on a later date, and to update landed cost of purchased items."
