msgstr "Contabilidad"

msgid "At the end of sales and purchase cycle comes billing and payments. You may have an accountant in your team, or you may be doing accounting yourself, or you may have outsourced your accounting. In all the cases financial accounting forms the core of any business management system like an ERP."
msgstr "Al final del ciclo de compras y ventas viene la facturación y pago. Puede tener un contador en su equipo, o puede estar llevando la contabilidad por usted mismo, o puede haber contratado un contador externo. En todos los casos la contabilidad financiera forma parte del núcleo de la sistema de administración financiera como un ERP."

msgid "In ERPNext, your accounting operations consists of 3 main transactions:"
msgstr "En ERPNext, su contabilidad consiste en 3 tipos principales de transacciones:"

msgid "Sales Invoice: The bills that you raise to your Customers for the products or services you provide."
msgstr "Facturas de Venta: Las facturas que hace a sus Clientes por los Productos y Servicios que vende."

msgid "Purchase Invoice: Bills that your Suppliers give you for their products or services."
msgstr "Factura de Compra: Factura que su Proveedor emite por productos o servicios."

msgid "Journal Vouchers: For accounting entries, like payments, credit and other types."
msgstr "Comprobante de Diario: Para registros contables, como pagos, créditos y otros tipos."

msgid "Introduction to Accounting"
msgstr "Introducción a la Contabilidad"

msgid "People new to accounting are often confused with the terms Debit and Credit. Contrary to their meaning, these terms have nothing to do with who owes what."
msgstr "Personas iniciándose  en la contabilidad generalmente se sienten confundidos con el concepto de Debe y Haber. Al contrario de su significado literal, estos términos no tienen nada que ver con quien debe que."

msgid "Debit and Credit"
msgstr "Débito y Crédito"

msgid "Debit and Credit are conventions. All accounting follows these, so that it is easy to understand the state of finances in a universal manner. These conventions are:"
msgstr "Débitos y Créditos son convenciones. Todos los contadores los siguen, así es fácil comprender el estado financiero de una empresa universalmente. Estas convenciones son:"

msgid "All Accounts are of type Debit or Credit."
msgstr "Todas las cuentas tienen movimientos Débito o Crédito."

msgid "Assets and Expenses (and their sub-groups) are always Debit."
msgstr "Activos y Gastos (y sus sub cuentas) son de Saldo Deudor."

msgid "Liabilities and Income (and their sub-groups) are always Credit."
msgstr "Pasivos e Ingresos (y sus sub cuentas) son de Saldo Acreedor."

msgid "In all accounting entries, you “debit” an Account or “credit” one."
msgstr "En todos los movimientos contables, \"debita\" una Cuenta y \"acredita\" otra."

msgid "When you “debit” a Debit Account (an asset or expense), its value increases (“add” operation). When you “credit” a Debit Account, its value decreases (“subtract” operation). The same rule applies for Credit Accounts. “Crediting” a Credit Account, increases its value, “debiting” it decreases its value."
msgstr "Cuando \"débita\" una Cuenta de Saldo Deudor (Activos o Gastos), aumenta su valor (un cargo a la cuenta). Cuando \"acredita\" una Cuenta de Saldo Deudor, su valor disminuye (un abono a la cuenta). La misma regla aplica para Cuentas de Saldo Acreedor. \"Acreditar\" una Cuenta de Saldo Acreedor, aumenta su valor, \"Debitarla\" disminuye su valor."

msgid "All accounting transactions (like a sales or a payment) must affect at least two different Accounts and sum of debits must be equal to sum of credits for the transaction. This is called the “double-entry bookkeeping system”."
msgstr "Todas las transacciones contables (como una venta o un pago) debe afectar al menos dos cuentas diferentes y la suma de los débitos debe ser igual que la suma de los créditos para la operación. Esta se conoce como \"sistema de contabilidad por partida doble\"."

msgid "Still confused? These conventions will become clear as you make transactions."
msgstr "¿Confundido? Todos estos conceptos se irán aclarando según valla realizando operaciones."

msgid "Accrual System"
msgstr "Sistema de Devengo"

msgid "Another important concept to understand in Accounting is accrual. This is important when your payment happens separately from delivery."
msgstr "Otro concepto importante para entender la contabilidad es el concepto de devengo. Este concepto es importante cuando sus pagos ocurren en fechas diferentes a la ventas."

msgid "For example, you buy X from a Supplier and your Supplier sends you a bill and expects you to pay in, for example, seven days. Even if you have not yet paid your Supplier, your expense must be booked immediately. This expense is booked against a group of Accounts called “Accounts Payable” that is the sum of all your outstanding dues to your Suppliers. This is called accrual. When you pay your Supplier, you will cancel his dues and update your bank account."
msgstr "Por ejemplo, usted compra un producto X de un Proveedor y su Proveedor le enviá una factura de crédito en espera de su pago, por ejemplo en siete días. Incluso si usted no ha realizado en pago a su Proveedor, usted debe contabilizar inmediatamente sus gastos. Este gasto se contabiliza contra un grupo de Cuentas llamado \"Cuentas por Pagar\" que representa la suma de todos los pagos pendientes a sus proveedores. Esto se conoce como devengo. Cuando paga a un proveedor, debe cancelar sus deudas y actualizar su cuenta bancaria."

msgid "ERPNext works on an accrual system. The transactions that accrue income and expense are Sales Invoice and Purchase Invoice."
msgstr "ERPNext trabaja con un sistema de devengo. Las transacciones que se acumulan como ingresos y gastos son de facturas de ventas y compras."

msgid "In retail, typically, delivery and payment happens at the same time. To cover this scenario, we have in ERPNext a POS Invoice (POS = Point of Sales). More on that later."
msgstr "En ventas al detalle, la entrega de los productos y los pagos suceden al mismo momento. Para cubrir este escenario, en ERPNext hay una Factura de POS (POS = Punto de Venta). Mas sobre eso después."

msgid "Sales"
msgstr "Ventas"

msgid "A Sales Invoice is a bill that you send to your customers, against which the customer processes the payment. Sales Invoice is an accounting transaction. On submission of Sales Invoice, the system updates the receivable and books income against a Customer Account."
msgstr "Una Factura de Venta es una factura que enviá a sus clientes, contra la que sus cliente realizan sus pagos. La Factura de Venta es una transacción contable. Al crear una Factura de Venta, el sistema actualiza el monto por cobrar y registra el ingreso contra una Cuenta de Clientes."

msgstr "Todas la ventas deben ser registradas contra un \"Cuenta de Ingresos\". Esto se refiere a una cuenta la sección \"Ingresos\" de su Catalogo de Cuentas.

msgid "\"Pro Forma\" Invoice"
msgstr "Factura \"Pro Forma\""

msgid "If you want to give an Invoice to a Customer to make a payment before you deliver, i.e. you operate on a payment first basis, you should create a Quotation and title it as a “Pro-forma Invoice” (or something similar) using the Print Heading feature."
msgstr "Si quiere dar a un Cliente una Factura para hacer un pago antes de haga el envió, por ejemplo trabaja en una sistema de pagos adelantados, debe crear una Cotización y definiría como una \"Factura Pro Forma\" (o algo similar) usando las opciones de membrete."

msgid "“Pro Forma” means for formality. Why do this? Because if you book a Sales Invoice it will show up in your “Accounts Receivable” and “Income”. This is not ideal as your Customer may or may not decide to pay up. But since your Customer wants an “Invoice”, you could give the Customer a Quotation (in ERPNext) titled as “Pro Forma Invoice”. This way everyone is happy."
msgstr "\"Pro Forma\" por asunto de formalidad. ¿Porqué hacer esto? Porque si registra una Factura de Venta esta aparecerá en sus \"Cuentas por Cobrar\" y de \"Ingresos\". Esto no es lo ideal si su cliente decide hacer o no hacer el pago. Pero debido a que su Cliente va a necesitar una \"Factura\", puede darle al cliente una Pro Forma (en ERPNext) con el titulo de \"Factura Pro Forma\". Esta mantendrá a todos felices."

Under these type of schemes, typically if a Supplier crosses a certain threshold of payment, and if the type of product is taxable, you may have to deduct some tax (which you pay back to your government, on your Supplier’s behalf)."
msgstr "En muchos países, las leyes obligan a deducir impuestos, al momento de pagar a los proveedores.  Estos impuestos se pueden basar en una tasa estándar. Según este tipo de esquemas, generalmente si un Proveedor acumula cierto monto de pago, y el producto es grabable posiblemente debe deducir algunos impuestos (los que deberá pagar al gobierno, a nombre del Proveedor)."

ERPNext sets up a simple chart of accounts for each Company you create, but you have to modify it according to your needs and legal requirements. ￼ For each company, Chart of Accounts signifies the way to classify the accounting entries, mostly based on statutory (tax, compliance to government regulations) requirements."
msgstr ""

msgid "Balance Sheet Accounts"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Balance Sheet has Application of Funds (Assets) and Sources of Funds (Liabilities) that signify the net-worth of your company at any given time. When you begin or end a financial period, all the Assets are equal to the Liabilities."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you are new to accounting, you might be wondering, how can Assets be equal to Liabilities? That would mean the company has nothing of its own. Thats right. All the “investment” made in the company to buy assets (like land, furniture, machines) is made by the owners and is a liability to the company. If the company would want to shut down, it would need to sell all the assets and pay back all the liabilities (including profits) to the owners, leaving itself with nothing."

msgid "Profit and Loss Accounts"
msgstr ""

msgid "Profit and Loss is the group of Income and Expense accounts that represent your accounting transactions over a period."
msgstr ""

msgid "Unlike Balance sheet accounts, Profit and Loss accounts (or PL accounts) do not represent net worth (assets), but rather represent the amount of money spent and collected in servicing customers during the period. Hence at the beginning and end of your Fiscal Year, they become zero."
msgstr ""

msgid "On the first day of the year you have not made any profit or loss, but you still have assets, hence balance sheet accounts never become zero at the beginning or end of a period"

msgid "Types of Assets (building, machinery, furniture etc.) under Fixed Assets."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cost Center and Budgeting"
msgstr ""

msgid "Your Chart of Accounts is mainly designed to provide reports to the government and tax authorities. ￼ Most businesses have multiple activities like different product lines, market segments, areas of business, etc that share some common overheads.They should ideally have their own structure to report, whether they are profitable or not. For this purpose, there is an alternate structure, called the Chart of Cost Centers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cost Center"

msgid "Online Sales"
msgstr ""

msgid "You may not have shipping expenses for your walk-in customers, and no shop- rent for your online customers.

Mark your all your purchases in the same way."

msgstr ""

msgid "A fiscal year is also known as a financial year or a budget year. It is used for calculating financial statements in businesses and other organisations. The fiscal year may or may not be the same as a calendar year. For tax purposes, companies can choose to be calendar-year taxpayers or fiscal-year taxpayers. In many jurisdictions, regulatory laws regarding accounting and taxation require such reports once per twelve months. However, it is not mandatory that the period should be a calendar year (that is, 1 January to 31 December)."
msgstr ""

msgid "A fiscal year usually starts at the beginning of a quarter, such as April 1, July 1 or October 1. However, most companies' fiscal year also coincides with the calendar year, which starts January 1. For the most part, it is simpler and easier that way. For some organizations, there are advantages in starting the fiscal year at a different time. For example, businesses that are seasonal might start their fiscal year on July 1 or October 1. A business that has most of its income in the fall and most of its expenses in the spring might also choose to start its fiscal year on October 1. That way, they know what their income will be for that year, and can adjust their expenses to maintain their desired profit margins."
