# Bill of Materials

<p class="lead">A Bill of Material (BOM) is a list of the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components, parts and the quantities of each needed to manufacture an end product [1].</p>

To enable production of work-orders based on make-to-stock system, go to the manufacturing module and create a Bill of Materials.

Making butterfly print bags requires only two operations. One, to stitch the bag from butterfly printed jute cloth and second, to fix jute handles in the loops made for them.

These steps will be mentioned in the BOM operations steps along with the material required for each step.

Save and submit the BOM. Submitting the BOM is an important step. The pricing is fixed only after the BOM is submitted. After submitting, you can create a Price List and Item Price into the system.
