Shades of Green attends 10 exhibitions per year. For the past 6 months they have been selling approximately 80-100 bags per exhibition. Based on past data they need minimum 100 bags per month to sell at exhibitions. 

Since they have established their brand, they are planning to sell aggressively at retail stores and to the newly established distributors. Thus, they have decided to produce 150 bags per month, since the monthly Stocks keep increasing in the Warehouses if not sold.
