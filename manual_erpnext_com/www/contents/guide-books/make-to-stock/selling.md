# Selling and Customer Billing

<p class="lead"> Selling to distributors/retailers is done by raising Sales Order, making  Delivery Note and Sales Invoice, and by making Payment Entry through a Journal Voucher.</p>

In this example, let us consider that a distributor has placed an order for 150 butterfly print bags. Let us also assume that the company did not attend the exhibition, due to last minute stall cancellation. Thus, we can assume that they agreed to supply the 150 butterfly print bags which were in Stock, to the distributor .

### Sales Order

Sales Order is an order issued by a business to a Customer. A Sales Order may be for products and/or services. [1]

> Selling > Sales Order > New Sales Order

Enter the amount that you will charge and the quantity of bags that are required. Save and submit the Sales Order.

> Sales Order is the main document that is used to track billing, delivery and manufacturing.
