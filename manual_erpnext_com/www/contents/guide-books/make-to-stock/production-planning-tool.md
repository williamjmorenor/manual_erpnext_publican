# Production Planning Tool

<p class="lead">Production Planning Tool helps to plan production and purchase Items. A list of Items can be generated from the open Sales Orders in the system. This tool creates Production Orders and generates Material Requests.</p>

The Production Planning Tool will generate:

1. **Production Orders** for selected Items 
2. **Material Requests** for Items whose Projected Quantity is likely to fall below zero.

The Production Planning Tool enables you to complete the production cycle in a fast and efficient manner. From procuring materials, producing goods, to updating stocks - everything is done by clicking on buttons which appear after every transaction. The tool is user friendly and does not require you to go back and forth into the system to make and log different forms. Everything is intuitive and can be performed step by step. 

In make-to-stock type of manufacturing, there are no pre-booked Sales Orders. Thus, in the Production Planning Tool, go directly to the Items table and pull the Item which requires Production Order and Material Requests.

#### Step 1: Click on 'Add New Row' and fill Item details

Do not tick the box that says ‘Use multi-level BOM’. This box is checked only if you have sub-assemblies. In other words, only if you have a BOM within a BOM. In the current example, there are no sub-assemblies.

#### Step 2: Create Production Order

Production Order is an order to produce a specific quantity of material within a predefined timeframe. It contains all of the relevant information required for the execution of the process, including how much should be manufactured when.
