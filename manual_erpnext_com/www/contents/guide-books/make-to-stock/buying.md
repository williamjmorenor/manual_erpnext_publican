# Buying

<p class="lead"> Material Requests can be used to generate Purchase Orders and Purchase Receipts.</p>

After creating Material Requests create Purchase Orders to buy raw materials. In order to manufacture 'Butterfly Print' bags, there is a need to buy butterfly printed jute cloth and 150 handles. Since one bag requires 1 meter jute cloth, for 150 bags we will require 150 meter jute cloth. Thus, it is essential to procure 150 jute handles and 150 meter jute cloth.

### Purchase Orders

A Purchase order (PO) is a commercial document and first official offer issued by a buyer to a seller, indicating types, quantities, and agreed prices for the products. [1] 

You can either create Purchase Orders directly by clicking on the Material Request form or by going to the Buying module and clicking on Purchase Order.

> Buying > Purchase Order > New Purchase Order

Make Purchase Order. Enter the rate and quantity in this form and save it. After saving, submit the form.

### Purchase Receipt

A Purchase receipt is a printed record that is given when a purchase has been made. It contains the detailed information of the Items purchased including the name of the Item, the price as well as the time when the purchase has been made.

> Note that only when the Purchase Receipt is submitted, the Stock balance is updated. To see the Stock balance go to the Stock module and select the Stock Balance Report from the Reports section.

The Suppliers who provide raw materials have to be paid. This is done by raising a Purchase Invoice and by making payments through Journal Vouchers.
