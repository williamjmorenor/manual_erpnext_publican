#### Step 1: Create a Price List 

Since you can maintain different prices for different regions, lets create a Price List for all the Distributors.

After creating a Price List template, you can click on the Action button and select to 'Add Prices'. The displayed form has a button 'New'. Click on that button to get a field for Item Price.

Based on the hourly rates of the labourers and the cost of raw material available in the Bill of Materials, you can devise your Item rate.
