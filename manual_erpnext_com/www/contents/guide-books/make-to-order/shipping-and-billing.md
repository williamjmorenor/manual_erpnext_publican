> Accounts > Journal Voucher

#### Double Entry Accounting

Double Entry Accounting or bookkeeping is a system of accounting in which every transaction has a corresponding positive and a negative entry: debits and credits. Every transaction involves a debit entry in one account and a credit entry in another account. This means that every transaction must be recorded in two accounts; one account will be debited, because it receives value and the other account will be credited, because it has given value. [2]
 
#### Journal Voucher

To make a Payment Entry update the Journal Voucher with debit and credit columns. Make sure to click on the button that says ‘Make Difference Entry’. Note that the reference number and reference date is mandatory along with the Account entry. In case for some reason, the account section is blank, it means that you have not selected your default bank account. To do so from the same form, click on the triangle button next to the Company and set the default master account.

The click will take you to the Master-Company page. Now enter your default entry account as HDFC Bank / Axis Bank etc and save. This will enable the system to post debit / credit entries directly against this particular account.
