<p class="lead"> A Sales Order is an order issued by a business to a Customer for products and / or services. [1]</p>

On completing the Bill of Materials, proceed to make a Sales Order into the system. Assuming that Shades of Green has received an order to deliver 50 Jute Pen-stands, create the Sales Order entry.

Save and submit the Sales Order. After creating the Sales Order the process to manufacture them begins. However, in order to manufacture, it is necessary that a Bill of Materials be made. This helps in production planning and making purchases as per requirements of the raw materials.

> Sales Order is the main document that is used to track billing, delivery and manufacturing.

Once the Sales Order is ready, we can proceed to the Production Planning Tool. This tool allows to pull a list of Items and Sales Orders, and generate a Production Order along with Material Requests.
