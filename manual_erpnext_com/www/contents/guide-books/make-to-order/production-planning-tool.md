#### Step 2: Get Items from Sales Order

Select Items by clicking on the ‘Get Items from Sales Order’ button. Do not tick the box that says ‘Use multi-level BOM’. This box is checked only if you have sub-assemblies. In other words, only if you have a BOM within a BOM. In the current example, there are no sub-assemblies.
