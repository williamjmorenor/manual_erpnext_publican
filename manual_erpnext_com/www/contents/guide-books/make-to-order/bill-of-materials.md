Let us make a BOM for the Jute Pen Stand. In the Bill of Materials we state the operations steps required to manufacture this Item. We also mention the raw materials required to manufacture this Item.

__Operations:__ List the operations step and the hourly rates along with the quantity of raw material required to produce the product.

> Note: Check the box that says â€˜With Operations-Manage Cost of Operation'.

__Materials Required:__ Mention the raw material list that is required to make the product.

__Note:__ You can enter the rates manually by adjusting as per the UOM. Since Tree Glue was purchased in Kg, calculate the rate for 10 gm and enter the rate accordingly. Do not forget to mention rates for every material.

Save the BOM and submit it. Do not forget to submit the BOM. This is an important step. The pricing is fixed only after the BOM is submitted. After submitting, you can create a Price List and Item Price into the system.
