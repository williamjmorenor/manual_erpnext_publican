# Purchase Order

<p class="lead"> A Purchase Order is created from a Material Request or from a Supplier Quotation, when there is no raw material in stock. After receiving the raw material a Purchase Receipt is generated.</p>

### Purchase Order

Purchase Order (PO) is a commercial document and first official offer issued by a buyer to a seller, indicating types, quantities, and agreed prices for the products [1]

You can make a Purchase Order from a Material Request or by directly going to:

> Buying > Purchase Order > New Purchase Order 

#### Step 1: Make Purchase Order

### Purchase Receipt

Purchase Receipt is a record that is made when a material is received. It is also known as a Goods Received Note (GRN). It contains detail information of the Items purchased including the name of the Item, the price as well as the time when the purchase has been made.

You can make a Purchase Receipt from the Purchase Order or directly from the Stock module.

> Stock > Purchase Receipt > New Purchase Receipt

In this manner create Purchase Orders and Purchase Receipts for all the Material Requests created by the Production Planning Tool. Remember to save and submit all the forms. 

> Note that only when the Purchase Receipt is submitted, the Stock balance is updated. To see the Stock balance go to the Stock module and select the Stock Balance Report from the Reports section.

After completing the Buying process by making Purchase Order and Purchase Receipt, proceed to manufacture the product.
