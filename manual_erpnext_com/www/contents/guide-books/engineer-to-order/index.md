# Engineer To Order

<p class="lead">This guide explains how a manufacturing unit would run its operations based on an engineer-to-order type of workflow.</p>

In engineer to order companies, a deal goes through multiple stages of discussions going back and forth. At each stage, new proposals are made and new costing for the product is prepared.

### Supreme Furniture

For this study, a furniture making company, Supreme Furniture, is used as a case-example.

 Supreme Furniture deals in all-types of furniture. They have a small showroom, where they keep some samples. However, they produce only after a Customer confirms the order and gives their specifications clearly.

> Note: Production Orders are issued based on customised order obtained after multiple iterations and may change even after production begins.

To explain the production cycle we will consider an example of a custom-made bed cum wardrobe for a child. Please read the Overview section to get a glimpse of all the steps required to complete an engineer-to-order cycle.
