ERPNext lets you maintain multiple selling and buying prices for an Item using Price Lists. A PriceList is a name you can give to a set of Item prices. 

Why would you want Price Lists? You have different prices for different zones (based on the shipping costs), for different currencies etc.

An Item can have multiple prices based on customer, currency, region, shipping cost etc, which can be stored as different rate plans. In ERPNext, you are required to store all the lists separately. Buying Price List is different from Selling Price List and thus is stored separately.

Standard Buying and Selling Price List are created by default.
