### 2. Add the user details

Add user details such as First Name, Last Name, Email etc.

The user's Email will become the user id.

After adding these details, save the user.

After saving, you will see a list of roles and a checkbox next to it. Just check the roles you want the
the user to have and save the document. To click on what permissions translate into roles, click on the role
name.

Users will have access to all modules for which they have role based access. If you want to block certain modules for certain users, un-check the module from the list.

If you wish to give the user access to the system only between office hours,
or during weekends, mention it under security settings.
