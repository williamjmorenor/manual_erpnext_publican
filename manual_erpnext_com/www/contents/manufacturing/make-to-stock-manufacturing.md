Make-to-stock manufacturing is a system based on keeping stocks ready for
customers in order to provide instant availability to customers. Products like
FMCG goods and electronics are made and stocked. Here, the production cycle is
completed before the sales orders are made.

This strategy is used by businesses to match production with consumer demand
forecasts. The make-to-stock (MTS) method forecasts demand, to determine how
much stock should be produced. If demand for the product can be accurately
forecasted, the MTS strategy can be an efficient choice.

The main drawback to the make-to-stock (MTS) method is that it relies heavily
on the accuracy of demand forecasts. Inaccurate forecasts will lead to losses
stemming from excessive inventory or stockouts.

In ERPNext, You can manually forecast and make Production Orders. To make
Production Orders, you can use the [Production Planning Tool](/contents/manufacturing/production-planning-tool).

Go to the Manufacturing Module to check your Production Order. Manually check
the Production Order and submit the order. After submitting, click on the
Action button, to get a drop-down list. Select Transfer Raw Material.
