### Material Requirements Planning (MRP):

The earliest ERP systems were made for manufacturing. The earliest adopters
were automobile companies who had thousands of raw materials and sub-
assemblies and found it very hard to keep track of requirements and plan
purchases. They started using computers to build the material requirements
from forecasts and Bill of Materials.

Later these systems were expanded to include Finances, Payroll, Order
Processing, and Purchasing and thus became the more generic Enterprise
Resource Systems (ERP). More recently Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
was added as a function and is now an integral part of ERP systems.

These days the term ERP is used to describe systems that help manage any kind
of organization like education institutes (Education ERP) or Hospitals
(Hospital ERP) and so on.
