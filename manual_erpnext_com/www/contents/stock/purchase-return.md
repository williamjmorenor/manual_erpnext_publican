ERPNext has an option to account for products that are returned to the
supplier. This may be on account of a number of reasons like defects in goods,
quality not matching, the buyer not needing the stock, etc. The transactions
dealing with return of goods are also accounting transactions and have to be
recorded in the books of accounts just like any other accounting transaction.

> If supplier doesn't send an invoice after sending goods, there is no need of
making a Debit Note. However, if he has sent an invoice and his goods are
returned due to some fault, then there could be 2 situations which arise;
either, you have made partial/full payment or not made any payment.

> Either way, generally supplier will issue you a Credit Note. And in that
case, you will make a Debit Note which will debit the supplier account and
credit the expense / stock received but not billed (perpetual inventory)
account. This Debit Note can be adjusted at the time of any future payment
against any outstanding invoices.
