### Best Practice

There are two aspects to good material management:

  * **Good housekeeping / visual control:** Keep all your items in separate bins,neatly stacked and labelled.“A place for everything and everything in its place”
  * **Accurate Data:** Accurate data comes from good processes and recording each and every transaction. If you are only partially recording your inventory then your reports will be incorrect “Garbage In Garbage Out”

If you have good processes to control movement of goods within your
organization, implementation in ERPNext will be a breeze.
