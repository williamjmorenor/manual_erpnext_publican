A Material Request is a simple document identifying a requirement of a set of
Items (products or services) for a particular reason.

To generate a Material Request manually go to:

> Buying > Documents > Material Request > New Material Request

#### Figure 1: Create Material Request

A Material Request can be generated:

  * By a User.
  * Automatically from a Sales Order.
  * Automatically when the Projected Quantity of an Item in stores reaches a particular level.
  * Automatically from your Bill of Materials if you use Production Plan to plan your manufacturing activities.

#### Figure 2: Complete Material Request Form

In the Material Request form,

  * Fill in the Items you want and their quantities.

  * If your Items are inventory items, you must also mention the Warehouse where you expect these Items to be delivered. This helps to keep track of the [Projected Quantity](/contents/stock/projected-quantity) for this Item.

  * You can optionally add the Terms, using the Terms and Conditions master and also the reason.

> Info: Material Request is not mandatory. It is ideal if you have centralized
buying so that you can collect this information from various departments.

#### Authorization

If you want your Material Request to be authorized by a senior person like a
Purchase Manager then you can give “Submit” rights only to that person.
Everyone can create requests, but only the authorized person can “Submit”.
