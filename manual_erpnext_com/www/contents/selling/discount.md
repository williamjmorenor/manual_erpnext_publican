While making your sales transactions like a Quotation (or Sales Order) you
would already have noticed that there is a “Discount” column. On the left is
the “Price List Rate” on the right is the “Basic Rate”. You can add a
“Discount” value to update the basic rate.

Since your taxes are calculated on Items, you must apply your discounts here
so that you apply the tax on the discounted rate, which is the case for most
taxes.

The second way to apply discount is to add it in your Taxes and Charges table.
This way you can explicitly show the Customer the discount you have applied on
the order. If you choose this method, remember that you will tax your Customer
at the full rate, not the discounted rate. So this is not a good way to track
discounts.

There is a third way to do it. Create an Item called “Discount” and make sure
that all the taxes apply in the same way as the main Items. (This method is
useful if only one type of tax is applicable on the sale). This way your
“Discount” will appear as an expense. You will see a slightly higher income
and expense but your profits will still remain the same. This method might be
interesting where you want detailed accounting of your discounts.

> Note: The maximum Discount that can be applied on an Item can be fixed in
the Item master.
