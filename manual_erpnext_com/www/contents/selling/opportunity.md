When you know a Lead is looking for some products or services to buy, you can
track that as an Opportunity.

You can create an Opportunity from:

> Selling > Opportunity > New Opportunity

or open a “Open” Lead and click on “Create Opportunity” button.

An Opportunity can also come from an existing Customer. You can create
multiple Opportunities against the same Lead. In Opportunity, apart from the
Communication, you can also add the Items for which the Lead or Contact is
looking for.

> Best Practice: Leads and Opportunities are often referred as your “Sales
Pipeline” this is what you need to track if you want to be able to predict how
much business you are going to get in the future. Its always a good idea to be
able to track what is coming in order to adjust your resources.
