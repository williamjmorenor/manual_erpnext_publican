Sales BOM stands for Sales Bill-of-Material. It's a master where you can list item which are bundled together and sold as one item. For instance, when laptop is delivered, you need to ensure that charger, mouse and laptop bag are delivered and stock level of these items gets affected. To address this scenario, you can set create Sales BOM for the main item, i.e. laptop, and list deliverable items i.e. laptop + charger + other accessories as child items.
  
Following are the steps on how to setup Sales BOM master, and how is it used in the sales transactions.

####Create new Sales BOM

To create new Sales BOM, Go to:

Selling >> Setup >> Sales BOM >> New

####Select Parent Item

In Sales BOM master, there are two sections. Sales BOM Item and Package Item.

In Sales BOM item, you will select a Parent Item. The parent item must be a <b>non-stock item</b>. This is non-stock item because there is no stock maintained for it but only the Package Items. If you want to maintain stock for the Parent Item, then you must create a regular Bill of Material (BOM) and package them using a Stock Entry Transactions.

In our case, the parent item is PC.

<div class="well"><b>Use Sales BOM to Manage Schemes:</b>
<br>
This work-around in Sales BOM was discovered when a customer dealing into nutrition product asked for feature to manage schemes like "Buy One Get One Free". To manage the same, he created a non-stock item which was used as Parent Item. In description of item, he entered scheme details with items image indicating the offer. The saleable product was selected in Package Item where qty was two. Hence every time they sold one qty of Parent item under scheme, system deducted two quantities of product from Warehouse.</div>
