	<title>Human Resource</title>
	<para>
	The Human Resources (HR) Module covers the processes linked to managing a team of co-workers. Most important feature here is processing the payroll by using the Salary Manager to generate Salary Slips. Most countries have complex tax rules stating which expenses the company can make on behalf of the Employees. There are a set of rules for the company to deduct taxes and social security from employee payroll. ERPNext allows to accomodate all types of taxes and their calculation.
	</para>
	<para>
	It also maintains a complete employee database including contact information, salary details, attendance, performance evaluation, and appraisal records.

		<title>Employee Master</title>
		<para>
		There are many fields you can add in your Employee records. As the organisation grows, it becomes difficult to manage more records. It is advisable to keep updating and entering records to facilitate data management of employees. Employee records also help in keeping a list of your team’s skills, previous employment history and emergency information. To create new Employee go to:

			<title>Numbering Employees (Employee ID)</title>
			<para>
			By default, in ERPNext Employee Records are Numbered. You can have multiple series if you are a really large company and want to have separate numbering series for separate locations etc. You can set the numbering series just like any other transaction by going to:
			</para>
			<programlisting>Setup > Customize > Document Numbering Series.
			</programlisting>
			<para>
			Alternatively, you can create employees by the “Employee Number” field if you already have an existing Employee Numbering system you want to follow. To set this, go to:
			</para>
			<programlisting>Setup > Global Defaults > HR

	<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Human_Resource-Leave">
		<title>Leave</title>
		<para>
		Fixed number of leaves per Employee can be allocated using the Leave Allocation Tool. If you have special leaves to be allocated, you can also allocate them manually by creating new Leave Allocation records.
		</para>
		<programlisting>HR > Leave Allocation > New Leave Allocation
		</programlisting>
		<para>
		If your company has a formal system where Employees have to apply for leaves to be able to qualify as paid leaveas, you can create Leave Application to track approval and usage of leaves. You have to mention the Employee, Leave Type and the period for which the leave is taken. If you want specific users to approve leaves, you can give “Submission” rights to those users only.
		</para>
		<programlisting>HR > Leave Application > Make New Leave Application
		</programlisting>
		<para>
		If you want all users to create their own Leave Applications, you can set their “Employee ID” as a match rule in the Leave Application Permission settings.

		An Attendance record stating that an Employee has been present on a particular day can be created manually by:
		</para>
		<programlisting>HR > Attendance > New Attendance 
		</programlisting>
		<para>
		It can also be done by collecting attendance information via an automated system like a swipe card. You can even upload a CSV file with the attendance information. You can get a monthly report of your Attendance data by going to the “Monthly Attendance Details” report. To upload the attendance go to:

			<title>Salary Structure</title>
			<para>
			The Salary Structure represents how Salaries are calculated based on Earnings and Deductions. Salary structures are used to help organizations: 1. Maintain pay levels that are competitive with the external labor market, 2. Maintain internal pay relationships among jobs, 3. Recognize and reward differences in level of responsibility, skill, and performance, and manage pay expenditures. The usual components of the salary structure include:
			</para>
			<para>
			Basic Salary: It is the taxable base income and generally not more than 40% of CTC.
			</para>
			<para>
			House Rent Allowance: The HRA constitutes 40 to 50% of the basic salary.
			</para>
			<para>
			Special Allowances: Makes up for the remainder part of the salary, mostly smaller than the basic salary which is completely taxable.
			</para>
			<para>
			Leave Travel Allowance: The non-taxable amount paid by the employer to the employee for vacation/trips with family within India.
			</para>
			<para>
			Gratuity: It is basically a lump sum amount paid by the employer when the employee resigns from the organization or retires.
			</para>
			<para>
			PF: Fund collected during emergency or old age. 12% of the basic salary is automatically deducted and goes to the employee provident fund.
			</para>
			<para>
			Medical Allowance: The employer pays the employee for the medical expenditures incurred. It is tax free up to Rs.15,000.
			</para>
			<para>
			Bonus: Taxable part of the CTC, usually a once a year lump sum amount, given to the employee based on the individual’s as well as the organizational performance for the year.
			</para>
			<para>
			Employee Stock Options: ESOPS are Free/discounted shares given by the company to the employees. This is done to primarily increase employee retention.
			</para>
			<para>
			To create a new Salary Structure go to:

					<para>In the “Earnings” and “Deductions” table all your defined Earning Type and Deductions Type will be auto-populated. Set the values of the Earnings and Deductions and save the Salary Structure.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<sect3>
				<title>Leave Without Pay</title>
				<para>
				Leave Without Pay (LWP) happens when an Employee runs out of allocated leaves or takes a leave without an approval (via Leave Application). If you want ERPNext to automatically deduct salary in case of LWP, then you must check on the “Apply LWP” column in the Earning Type and Deduction Type masters. The amount of pay cut is the proportion of LWP days divided by the total working days for the month (based on the Holiday List). If you don’t want ERPNext to manage LWP, just don’t click on LWP in any of the Earning Types and Deduction Types.
				</para>

				<title>Creating Salary Slips</title>
				<para>
				Once the Salary Structure is created, you can make a salary slip from the same form or you can process your payroll for the month using the Salary Manager. To create a salary slip from Salary Structure, click on the button Make Salary Slip. Through Salary Manager:
				</para>
				<programlisting>HR > Process Payroll
				</programlisting>
				<para>
				In the Salary Manager tool:
				</para>

					<listitem>
						<para>Select the Month and the Year for which you want to create the Salary Slips.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Click on “Create Salary Slips”. This will create Salary Slip records for each active Employee for the month selected. If the Salary Slips are created, the system will not create any more Salary Slips. All updates will be shown in the “Activity Log” section.</para>

				<title>Booking Salaries in Accounts</title>
				<para>
				The final step is to book the Salaries in your Accounts. Salaries in businesses are usually dealt with extreme privacy. In most cases, the companies issues a single payment to the bank combining all salaries and the bank distributes the salaries to each employee’s salary account. This way there is only one payment entry in the company’s books of accounts and anyone with access to the company’s accounts will not have access to the individual salaries.
				</para>
				<para>
				The salary payment entry is a Journal Voucher entry that debits the total salary of all Employees to the Salary Account and credits the company’s bank Account. To generate your salary payment voucher from the Salary Manager, click on “Make Bank Voucher” and a new Journal Voucher with the total salaries will be created.

		</para>
		<sect2>
			<title>Approving Expenses</title>
			<para>

Comments can be added in the Comments section explaining why the claim was approved or rejected.
			</para>
			<sect3>
				<title>Booking the Expense and Reimbursement</title>
				<para>

		<title>Apraisal</title>
		<para>
