	In this module, you can track incoming queries from your email using Support Ticket. You can keep track on Customer Issues raised by Customers on specific Serial No and respond to them based on their warranty and other information. You can also make Maintenance Schedules for Serial Nos and keep a record of all Maintenance Visits made to your Customers.

		</para>
		<programlisting>
		Support > Issue > New Issue
		</programlisting>

			<title>Discussion Thread</title>
			<para>
			When a new email is fetched from your mailbox, a new Issue record is created and an automatic reply is sent to the sender indicating the Support Ticket Number. The sender can send additional information to this email. All subsequent emails containing this Issue number in the subject will be added to this Issue thread. The sender can also add attachments to the email. Issue maintains all the emails which are sent back and forth against this issue in the system so that you can track what transpired between the sender and the person responding.
			</para>
			<sect3>
				<title>Status</title>
				<para>
				When a new Issue is created, its status is “Open”, when it is replied, its status becomes “Waiting for Reply”. If the sender replies back its status again becomes “Open”.

				<title>Closing</title>

		<title>Customer Issue</title>
		<para>
		If you are selling Items under warranty or if you have sold and extended service contract like the Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC), your Customer may call you about an issue or a break-down and give you the Serial No of this Item. To record this, you can create a new Customer Issue and add the Customer and Item / Serial No. The system will then automatically fetch the Serial No’s details and indicate whether this is under warranty or AMC.
		</para>
		<para>
		You must also add a description of the Customer’s issue and assign it to the person who needs to look into solving the issue. To create a new Customer Issue:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
		Support > Customer Issue > New Customer Issue
		</programlisting>
		<para>
		If a Customer visit is required to address the issue, you can create a new Maintenance Visit record from this.
		</para>

		<title>Maintance Sschedule</title>

		All machines require regular maintenance, specially those that contain a lot of moving parts, so if you are in the business of maintaining those or have some of them in your own premises, this is a useful tool to plan a calendar of activities for its maintenance. If the Customer Issue refers to “Breakdown Maintenance”, this refers to “Preventive Maintenance”. To create a new Maintenance Schedule go to:

		</para>
		<para>
		The second section contains the maintenance activities planned in the schedule. “Generate Schedule” will generate a separate row for each maintenance activity.
