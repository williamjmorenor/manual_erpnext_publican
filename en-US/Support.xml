<para>Great customer support and maintenance is at the heart of any successful small business. ERPNext gives you the tools to
	track all incoming requests and issues from your customers so that you can respond quickly. Your database of incoming queries
	will also help you track where the biggest opportunities are for improvements.</para>
<para>In this module, you can track incoming queries from your email using Support Ticket. You can keep track on Customer Issues
	raised by Customers on specific Serial No and respond to them based on their warranty and other information. You can also make
	Maintenance Schedules for Serial Nos and keep a record of all Maintenance Visits made to your Customers.</para>
<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Support-Issue">
<title>Issue</title>
<para>Issue is an incoming query from your Customer, usually via email or from the “Contact” section of your website. (To fully
	integrate the Support Ticket to email, see the Email Settings section). To create a new Issue, go to:</para>
<programlisting>Support > Issue > New Issue</programlisting>
<note><para>A dedicated support email id is a good way to integrate incoming queries via email. For example, you can send support
	queries to ERPNext at support@erpnext.com and it will automatically create a Issue in the Frappe system.</para></note>
<sect2>
<title>Discussion Thread</title>
<para>When a new email is fetched from your mailbox, a new Issue record is created and an automatic reply is sent to the sender
	indicating the Support Ticket Number. The sender can send additional information to this email. All subsequent emails containing
	this Issue number in the subject will be added to this Issue thread. The sender can also add attachments to the email. Issue
	maintains all the emails which are sent back and forth against this issue in the system so that you can track what transpired
	between the sender and the person responding.</para>
<sect3>

<para>When a new Issue is created, its status is “Open”, when it is replied, its status becomes “Waiting for Reply”. If the sender
	replies back its status again becomes “Open”.</para>

<title>Customer Issue</title>
<para>If you are selling Items under warranty or if you have sold and extended service contract like the Annual Maintenance Contract
	(AMC), your Customer may call you about an issue or a break-down and give you the Serial No of this Item. To record this, you can
	create a new Customer Issue and add the Customer and Item / Serial No. The system will then automatically fetch the Serial No’s
	details and indicate whether this is under warranty or AMC.</para>
<para>You must also add a description of the Customer’s issue and assign it to the person who needs to look into solving the issue.
	To create a new Customer Issue:</para>
<programlisting>Support > Customer Issue > New Customer Issue</programlisting>
