<title>Setting Up</title>
<para>Setting up an ERP system is like starting your business all over again, although
	in the virtual world. Thankfully it is not as hard as the real business and you get to
	do a trial too!</para>
<para>Implementation requires the implementer to take a step back and set aside some
	time to do this right. This is usually not a couple-of-hours, after-work kind of
	a project.</para>

<title>Setup Wizard</title>
<note><para>The first time than you logging into ERPNext you will need to create

From the perspective of the buyer, it is a tax on the purchase price. From that of the seller, it is
a tax only on the value added to a product, material, or a service. From an accounting point of view,
by the stage of its manufacture or distribution. The manufacturer remits to the government the
difference between these two amounts, and retains the rest for themselves to offset the taxes they had
previously paid on the inputs.</para>
<para>The purpose of VAT is to generate tax revenues to the government similar to the corporate income
	tax or the personal income tax. For Example: When you shop at a departmental store and avail discount
	on the products, the store charges you 5% extra on the total bill as the VAT.</para>

		<title>Role Based Permissions</title>
		<para>
		ERPNext has a role-based permission system. It means that you can assign Roles to Users, and set Permissions on Roles. The permission structure also allows you to define different permission rules for different fields, using a concept called Permission "Level" of a field. Once roles are assigned to a user, it gives you the ability to limit access for a user to only specic documents.

		Data records are broadly classified as “Master” or “Transaction”. A master record is a record that has a “name”, for example a Customer, Item, Supplier, Employee etc. A Transaction is a record that has a “number”. Examples of transactions include Sales Invoices, Quotations etc. You make transactions against a number of master records.
		</para>

		ERPNext allows you to make prefixes to your transactions, with each prefix forming its own series. For example a series with prefix INV12 will have numbers INV120001, INV120002 and so on.
		</para>
		<para>
		You can have multiple series for all your transactions. It is common to have a separate series for each financial year. For example in Sales Invoice you could have:
