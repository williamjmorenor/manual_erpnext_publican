<title>Accounts</title>
<para>At the end of sales and purchase cycle comes billing and payments. You may have an accountant in your team, or you may
	be doing accounting yourself, or you may have outsourced your accounting. In all the cases financial accounting forms the
	core of any business management system like an ERP.</para>
<para>In ERPNext, your accounting operations consists of 3 main transactions:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Sales Invoice: The bills that you raise to your Customers for the products or services you provide.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Purchase Invoice: Bills that your Suppliers give you for their products or services.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Journal Vouchers: For accounting entries, like payments, credit and other types.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Accounts-Introduction">
<title>Introduction to Accounting</title>
<para>People new to accounting are often confused with the terms Debit and Credit. Contrary to their meaning, these terms have
			nothing to do with who owes what.</para>
<sect2>
<title>Debit and Credit</title>
<para>Debit and Credit are conventions. All accounting follows these, so that it is easy to understand the state of finances in
	a universal manner. These conventions are:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>All Accounts are of type Debit or Credit.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Assets and Expenses (and their sub-groups) are always Debit.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Liabilities and Income (and their sub-groups) are always Credit.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>In all accounting entries, you “debit” an Account or “credit” one.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>When you “debit” a Debit Account (an asset or expense), its value increases (“add” operation). When you “credit” a Debit Account,
	its value decreases (“subtract” operation). The same rule applies for Credit Accounts. “Crediting” a Credit Account, increases its
	value, “debiting” it decreases its value.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>All accounting transactions (like a sales or a payment) must affect at least two different Accounts and sum of debits must be
	equal to sum of credits for the transaction. This is called the “double-entry bookkeeping system”.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Still confused? These conventions will become clear as you make transactions.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Accrual System</title>
<para>Another important concept to understand in Accounting is accrual. This is important when your payment happens separately from
	delivery.</para>
<para>For example, you buy X from a Supplier and your Supplier sends you a bill and expects you to pay in, for example, seven days.
	Even if you have not yet paid your Supplier, your expense must be booked immediately. This expense is booked against a group of
	Accounts called “Accounts Payable” that is the sum of all your outstanding dues to your Suppliers. This is called accrual. When you
	pay your Supplier, you will cancel his dues and update your bank account.</para>
<para>ERPNext works on an accrual system. The transactions that accrue income and expense are Sales Invoice and Purchase
	Invoice.</para>
<para>In retail, typically, delivery and payment happens at the same time. To cover this scenario, we have in ERPNext a POS Invoice
	(POS = Point of Sales). More on that later.</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Accounts-Sales">
<title>Sales</title>
<para>A Sales Invoice is a bill that you send to your customers, against which the customer processes the payment. Sales Invoice is an
	accounting transaction. On submission of Sales Invoice, the system updates the receivable and books income against a Customer Account.
</para>
<para>You can create a Sales Invoice directly from</para>
<programlisting>Accounting > Documents > Sales Invoice > New Sales Invoice</programlisting>
<para>or Click on Make Invoice at the right hand corner of the Delivery Note.</para>
<sect2>
<title>Accounting Impact</title>
<para>All Sales must be booked against an “Income Account”. This refers to an Account in the “Income” section of your Chart of Accounts.
	It is a good practice to classify your income by type (like product income, service income etc). The Income Account must be set for
	each row of the Items table.</para>
<note><para>To set default Income Accounts for Items, you can set it in the Item or Item Group.</para></note>
<para>The other account that is affected is the Account of the Customer. That is automatically set from “Debit To” in the heading
	section.</para>
<para>You must also mention the Cost Centers in which your Income must be booked. Remember that your Cost Centers tell you the
	profitability of the different lines of business or product. You can also set a default Cost Center in the Item master.</para>
<sect3>
<title>Accounting entries (GL Entry) for a typical double entry “Sale”:</title>
<para>When booking a sale (accrual):</para>
<para>Debit: Customer (grand total) Credit: Income (net total, minus taxes for each Item) Credit: Taxes (liabilities to be paid to the
	government)</para>
<note><para>To see entries in your Sales Invoice after you “Submit”, click on “View Ledger”.</para></note>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>Dates</title>
<para>Posting Date: The date on which the Sales Invoice will affect your books of accounts i.e. your General Ledger. This will affect
	all your balances in that accounting period.</para>
<para>Due Date: The date on which the payment is due (if you have sold on credit). This can be automatically set from the Customer
	master.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>Recurring Invoices</title>
<para>If you have a contract with a Customer where you bill the Customer on a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annual basis, you
	can check the “Recurring Invoice” box. Here you can fill in the details of how frequently you want to bill this Invoice and the
	period for which the contract is valid.</para>
<para>ERPNext will automatically create new Invoices and mail it to the email ids you set.</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>"Pro Forma" Invoice</title>
<para>If you want to give an Invoice to a Customer to make a payment before you deliver, i.e. you operate on a payment first basis,
	you should create a Quotation and title it as a “Pro-forma Invoice” (or something similar) using the Print Heading feature.</para>
<para>“Pro Forma” means for formality. Why do this? Because if you book a Sales Invoice it will show up in your “Accounts Receivable”
	and “Income”. This is not ideal as your Customer may or may not decide to pay up. But since your Customer wants an “Invoice”, you
	could give the Customer a Quotation (in ERPNext) titled as “Pro Forma Invoice”. This way everyone is happy.</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Accounts-Purchase">
<title>Purchase Invoice</title>
<para>Purchase Invoice is the exact opposite of your Sales Invoice. It is the bill that your Supplier sends you for products or
	services delivered. Here you accrue expenses to your Supplier. Making a Purchase Invoice is very similar to making a
	Purchase Order.</para>
<para>To make a new Purchase Invoice, go to:</para>
<programlisting>Accounts > Documents > Purchase Invoice > New Purchase Invoice</programlisting>
<para>or click on “Make Purchase Invoice” in Purchase Order or Purchase Receipt.</para>
<note><para>The concept of “Posting Date” is again same as Sales Invoice. “Bill No” and “Bill Date” helps to track the bill number
	as set by your Supplier for reference.</para></note>
<sect2>
<title>Accounting Impact</title>
<para>Like in Sales Invoice, you have to enter an Expense or an Asset account for each row in your Items table. This helps to indicate
	if the Item is an Asset or an Expense. You must also enter a Cost Center. These can also be set in the Item master.</para>
<para>The Purchase Invoice will affect your accounts as follows:</para>
<para>Accounting entries (GL Entry) for a typical double entry “purchase”:</para>
<para>Debits:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Expense or Asset (net totals, excluding taxes)</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Taxes (assets if VAT-type or expense again).</para>

<para>Credits:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Supplier</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>To see entries in your Purchase Invoice after you “Submit”, click on “View Ledger”.</para>
<sect3>
<title>Is purchase an “Expense” or an “Asset”?</title>
<para>If the Item is consumed immediately on purchase, or if it is a service, then the purchase becomes an “Expense”. For example,
	a telephone bill or travel bill is an “Expense” - it is already consumed.</para>
<para>For inventory Items, that have a value, these purchases are not yet “Expense”, because they still have a value while they
	remain in your stock. They are “Assets”. If they are raw-materials (used in a process), they will become “Expense” the moment
	they are consumed in the process. If they are to be sold to a Customer, they become “Expense” when you ship them to the
	Customer.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>Deducting Taxes at Source</title>
<para>In many countries, the law may require you to deduct taxes, while paying your suppliers. These taxes could be based on a
	standard rate. Under these type of schemes, typically if a Supplier crosses a certain threshold of payment, and if the type
	of product is taxable, you may have to deduct some tax (which you pay back to your government, on your Supplier’s behalf).</para>
<para>To do this, you will have to make a new Tax Account under “Tax Liabilities” or similar and credit this Account by the
	percent you	are bound to deduct for every transaction.</para>
<important><para>Taxes are an essential part of accounting, if you are miscalculating taxes your business may be at risk of fines
	and	tax charges. If you are unsure about the calculation or application of any tax consult your accountant or tax
	specialist.</para></important>
</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Accounts-Payments">
<title>Making Payments</title>
<para>Payments made against Sales Invoices or Purchase Invoices can be made by clicking on “Make Payment Entry” button on “Submitted”

<sect2>
<title>Reconciling Cheque Payments</title>
<para>If you are receiving payments or making payments via cheques, the bank statements will not accurately match the dates of your
	entry, this is because the bank usually takes time to “clear” these payments. Also you may have mailed a cheque to your Supplier
	and it may be a few days before it is received and deposited by the Supplier. In ERPNext you can synchronize your bank statements
	and your Journal Vouchers using the “Bank Reconciliation” tool.</para>
<para>To use this, go to:</para>
<programlisting>Accounts > Tools > Bank Reconciliation</programlisting>
<para>Select your “Bank” Account and enter the dates of your statement. Here you will get all the “Bank Voucher” type entries. In each
	of the entry on the right most column, update the “Clearance Date” and click on “Update”.</para>
<para>By doing this you will be able to sync your bank statements and entries into the system.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Managing Outstanding Payments</title>
<para>In most cases, apart from retail sales, billing and payments are separate activities. There are several combinations in which
	these payments are done. These cases apply to both sales and purchases.</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>They can be upfront (100% in advance).</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Post shipment. Either on delivery or within a few days of delivery.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Part in advance and part on or post delivery.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Payments can be made together for a bunch of invoices.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Advances can be given together for a bunch of invoices (and can be split across invoices).</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>ERPNext allows you to manage all these scenarios. All accounting entries (GL Entry) can be made against a Sales Invoice,
	Purchase Invoice or Journal Vouchers (in special cases, an invoice can be made via a Sales Invoice too).</para>
<para>The total outstanding amount against an invoice is the sum of all the accounting entries that are made “against” (or are linked
	to) that invoice. This way you can combine or split payments in Journal Vouchers to manage the scenarios.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Matching Payments to Invoices</title>
<para>In complex scenarios, especially in the capital goods industry, sometimes there is no direct link between payments and invoices.
You send invoices to your Customers and your Customer sends you block payments or payments based on some schedule that is not linked
to your invoices.</para>
<para>In such cases, you can use the Payment to Invoice Matching Tool.</para>
<programlisting>Accounts > Tools > Payment Reconciliation</programlisting>
<para>In this tool, you can select an account (your Customer’s account) and click on “Pull Payment Entries” and it will select all
	un-linked Journal Vouchers and Sales Invoices from that Customer.</para>
<para>To cancel off some payments and invoices, select the Invoices and Journal Vouchers and click on “Reconcile”.</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Accounts-Advance">
<title>Advance Payment Entry</title>
<para>Payment done by the customer before accepting delivery of the product is an Advance Payment. For Orders of high value, the
	business houses expect to receive advance.</para>
<para>For Example: Consider a customer- Jane D'souza placing an order for a double bed costing Rs 100000/- She is asked to give
	some advance before the furniture house begins work on her order. She gives them Rs 1000/- in cash.</para>
<para>Go to Accounts and open a new Journal Voucher to make the advance entry.</para>
<programlisting>Accounts > Documents > Journal Voucher > New Journal Voucher</programlisting>
<para>Mention the voucher type as cash voucher. This differs for different customers. If somebody pays by cheque the voucher type
	will be Bank Voucher. Then select the customer account and make the respective debit and credit entries.</para>
<para>Since the customer has given 10000/- as cash advance,it will be recorded as a credit entry against the customer. To balance
	it with the debit entry[Double accounting Entry]enter 10000/- as debit against the company's cash account. In the row "Is Advance"
	click 'Yes'.</para>
<sect2>
<title>Double Entry Accounting</title>
<para>Double entry bookkeeping is a system of accounting in which every transaction has a corresponding positive and negative entry :
	debits and credits. Every transaction involves a debit entry in one account and a credit entry in another account. This means that
	every transaction must be recorded in two accounts; one account will be debited because it receives value and the other account will
	be credited because it has given value.</para>
<para>Save and submit the JV. If this document is not saved it will not be pulled in other accounting documents.</para>
<para>When you make a new Sales Invoice for the same customer, mention the advance in the Sales Invoice Form.</para>
<para>To link the Sales Invoice to the Journal Voucher which mentions the advance payment entry, click on ‘Get Advances Received’.
	Allocate the amount of advance in the advances table. The accounting will be adjusted accordingly.</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Accounts-Journal">
<title>Journal Vouchers</title>
<para>All types of accounting entries other than Sales Invoice and Purchase Invoice are made using the Journal Voucher. A Journal
	Voucher (also called Journal Entry) is a standard accounting transaction that affects multiple Accounts and the sum of debits is
	equal to the sum of credits.</para>
<para>To create a Journal Voucher go to:</para>
<programlisting>Accounts > Documents > Journal Voucher > New Journal Voucher</programlisting>

<title>Credit Limit</title>
<para>A credit limit is the maximum amount of credit that a financial institution or other lender will extend to a debtor for a

<title>Openning Entry</title>
<para>If you are a new company you can start using ERPNext accounting module by going to chart of accounts.</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Opening Account balances.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Opening Stock balances.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>To setup your accounts and stock correctly you will need accurate data to work with. Make sure you have the data setup for
	this.</para>
<sect3>
<title>Opening Accounts</title>
<para>We usually recommend that you start using accounting in a new financial year, but you could start midway too. To setup your
	accounts, you will need the following for the “day” you start using accounting in ERPNext:</para>
<para>Opening capital accounts - like your shareholder’s (or owner’) capital, loans, bank balances on that day. List of outstanding
	sales and purchase invoices (Payables and Receivables).</para>
<para>Based on Voucher Type</para>
<para>You can select accounts based on the voucher type. In such a scenario, your balance sheet should be balanced.</para>
<para>Also, note that if there are more than 300 ledgers, the system will crash. Thus to avoid such a situation, you can open accounts
	by using temporary accounts.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>Temporary Accounts</title>
<para>A nice way to simplify opening is to use a temporary account just for opening. These accounts will become zero once all your
	old invoices and opening balances of bank, debt stock etc are entered. In the standard chart of accounts, a Temperory Opening
	account is created under assets</para>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>The Opening Entry</title>
<para>In ERPNext Opening Accounts are setup by submitting a special Journal Entries (Journal Voucher).</para>
<note><para>Make sure to set “Is Opening” as “Yes” in the More Info section.</para></note>
<programlisting>Setup > Opening Accounts and Stock > Opening Accounting Entries.</programlisting>
<para>Complete Journal Entries on the Debit and Credit side.</para>
<para>To update opening balance is to make Journal Voucher for an individual/group of accounts. For example, if you want to update
	balance in three bank accounts, then make Journal Vouchers in this manner.</para>
<para>Temporary Asset and Liability account is used for balancing purpose. When you update opening balance in Liability Account, you
	can use Temporary Asset Account for balancing. This way, you can update opening balance in Asset and Liability accounts.</para>
<para>You can make two Opening Journal Vouchers:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>For all assets (excluding Accounts Receivables): This entry will contain all your assets except the amounts you are
	expecting from your Customers against outstanding Sales Invoices. You will have to update your receivables by making an individual
	entry for each Invoice (this is because, the system will help you track the invoices which are yet to be paid). You can credit the
	sum of all these debits against the Temperory Opening account.</para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>For all liabilities: Similarly you need to pass a Journal Voucher for your Opening Liabilities (except for the bills you have
	to pay) against Temperory Opening account.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>In this method you can update opening balance of specific balancesheet accounts and not for all.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<note><para>Opening entry is only for balance sheet accounts and not for expense or Income accounts.</para></note>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>Outstanding Invoices</title>
<para>After your Opening Journal Vouchers are made, you will need to enter each Sales Invoice and Purchase Invoice that is yet to
	be paid. Since you have already booked the income or expense on these invoices in the previous period, select the temp opening
	account Temporary Opening in the “Income” and “Expense” accounts.</para>
<important><para>Make sure to set each invoice as “Is Opening”!</para></important>
<para>If you don’t care what items are in that invoice, just make a dummy item entry in the Invoice. Item code in the Invoice is not

<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Accounts-Closing">
<title>Closing a Financial Period</title>
<para>At the end of every year or (quarterly or maybe even monthly), after completing auditing, you can close your books of accounts.

<para>By doing this, your balance in your Income and Expense Accounts become zero. You start a new Fiscal Year (or period) with
	a balanced Balance Sheet and fresh Profit and Loss account. In ERPNext after making all the special entries via Journal Voucher
	for the current fiscal year, you should set all your Income and Expense accounts to zero via:</para>
<programlisting>Accounts > Tools > Period Closing Voucher</programlisting>
<para>Posting Date will be when this entry should be executed. If your Fiscal Year ends on 31st December, then that date should be
	selected as Posting Date in the Period Closing Voucher.</para>
<para>Transaction Date will be Period Closing Voucher's creation date.</para>
<para>Closing Fiscal Year will be an year for which you are closing your financial statement.</para>
<para>This voucher will transfer Profit or Loss (availed from PL statment) to Closing Account Head. You should select a libility
	account like Reserves and Surplus, or Capital Fund account as Closing Account.</para>
<para>The Period Closing Voucher will make accounting entries (GL Entry) making all your Income and Expense Accounts zero and

<title>Bank Reconciliation</title>
<para>A Bank Reconciliation is a process that explains the difference between the bank balance shown in an organisation's bank
	statement, as supplied by the bank, and the corresponding amount shown in the organisation's own accounting records at a
	particular point in time.</para>

<title>Budgetting</title>
<para>ERPNext will help you set and manage budgets on your Cost Centers. This is useful when, for example, you are doing online sales.
	You have a budget for search ads, and you want ERPNext to stop or warn you from over spending, based on that budget.</para>
<para>Budgets are also great for planning purposes. When you are making plans for the next financial year, you would typically target
	a revenue based on which you would set your expenses. Setting a budget will ensure that your expenses do not get out of hand, at any
	point, as per your plans. You can define it in the Cost Center. If you have seasonal sales you can also define a budget distribution
	that the budget will follow.</para>
<para>In order to allocate budget, go to</para>
<programlisting>Accounts > Setup > Chart of Cost Centers</programlisting>
<para>and click on Chart of Cost Center. Select a Cost Center and click on Open.</para>
<para>ERPNext allows you to take a few budget actions. It signifies whether to stop , warn or Ignore if you exceed budgets.</para>
<para>These can be defined from the Company record.</para>
<para>Even if you choose to “ignore” budget overruns, you will get a wealth of information from the “Budget vs Actual” variance report.
	This report shows month wise actual expenses as compared to the budgeted expenses.</para>

<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Accounts-Chart">
<title>Chart Of Accounts</title>
<para>The Chart of Accounts forms the blueprint of your organization. The overall structure of your Chart of Accounts is based on a
	system of double entry accounting that has become a standard all over the world to quantify how a company is doing financially.
	The Chart of Accounts helps you to answer:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>What is your organisation worth?</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>How much debt have you taken?</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>How much profit are you making (and hence paying tax)?</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>How much are you selling?</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>What is your expense break-up</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>You may note that as a business manager, it is very valuable to see how well your business is doing.</para>
<note><para>If you can’t read a Balance Sheet it's a good opportunity to start learning about this. It will be worth
	the effort. Your Chart of Accounts is the heart of your financial reports, is there is a Chart of Account for
	available for your country in ERPNext you can set it in the Wizard Setup. If you need help configuring your Chart of
	Account contact a Accountant..</para></note>
<para>To edit your Chart of Accounts in ERPNext go to:</para>
<programlisting>Accounts > Setup > Chart of Accounts</programlisting>
<para>Chart of Accounts is a tree view of the names of the Accounts (Ledgers and Groups) that a Company requires to
	manage its books of accounts. ERPNext sets up a simple chart of accounts for each Company you create, but you have to modify
	it according to your needs and legal requirements. ￼ For each company, Chart of Accounts signifies the way to classify the
	accounting entries, mostly based on statutory (tax, compliance to government regulations) requirements.</para>
<sect2>
<title>Balance Sheet Accounts</title>
<para>The Balance Sheet has Application of Funds (Assets) and Sources of Funds (Liabilities) that signify the net-worth of your
	company at any given time. When you begin or end a financial period, all the Assets are equal to the Liabilities.</para>
<note><para>If you are new to accounting, you might be wondering, how can Assets be equal to Liabilities? That would mean the
	company has nothing of its own. Thats right. All the “investment” made in the company to buy assets (like land, furniture, machines)
	is made by the owners and is a liability to the company. If the company would want to shut down, it would need to sell all the
	assets and pay back all the liabilities (including profits) to the owners, leaving itself with nothing.</para></note>
<para>All the accounts under this represent an asset owned by the company like "Bank Account", "Land and Property", "Furniture" or a
	liability (funds that the company owes to others) like "Owners funds", "Debt" etc.</para>
<para>Two special accounts to note here are Accounts Receivable (money you have to collect from your customers) and Accounts Payable
	(money you have to pay to your suppliers) under Assets and Liabilities respectively.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Profit and Loss Accounts</title>
<para>Profit and Loss is the group of Income and Expense accounts that represent your accounting transactions over a period.</para>
<para>Unlike Balance sheet accounts, Profit and Loss accounts (or PL accounts) do not represent net worth (assets), but rather
	represent the amount of money spent and collected in servicing customers during the period. Hence at the beginning and end
	of your Fiscal Year, they become zero.</para>
<note><para>On the first day of the year you have not made any profit or loss, but you still have assets, hence balance sheet accounts
	never become zero at the beginning or end of a period</para></note>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Groups and Ledgers</title>
<para>There are two main kinds of Accounts in ERPNext - Group and Ledger. Groups can have sub-groups and ledgers within them, whereas
	ledgers are the leaf nodes of your chart and cannot be further classified.</para>
<para>Accounting Transactions can only be made against Ledger Accounts (not Groups)</para>
<important><para> The term "Ledger" means a page in an accounting book where entries are made. There is usually one ledger for each
	account (like a Customer or a Supplier).</para></important>
<note><para>An Account “Ledger” is also sometimes called as Account “Head”.</para></note>
<sect3>
<title>Other Account Types</title>
<para>In ERPNext, you can also specify more information when you create a new Account, this is there to help you select that particular
	account in a scenario like Bank Account or a Tax Account and has no effect on the Chart itself. You can also tag if an account
	represents a Customer, Supplier or Employee in "Master Type".</para>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>Creating / Editing Accounts</title>
<para>To create new Accounts, explore your Chart of Accounts and click on an Account group under which you want to create the new
	Account. On the right side, you will see an option to “Open” or “Add Child” a new Account.</para>
<para>Option to create will only appear if you click on a Group (folder) type Account.</para>
<para>ERPNext creates a standard structure for you when the Company is created but it is up to you to modify or add or remove
	accounts.</para>
<para>Typically, you might want to create Accounts for</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Types of Expenses (travel, salaries, telephone etc) under Expenses.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Taxes (VAT, Sales Tax etc based on your country) under Current Liabilities.</para></listitem>

<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Accounts-Cost_Center">
<title>Cost Center and Budgeting</title>
<para>Your Chart of Accounts is mainly designed to provide reports to the government and tax authorities. ￼ Most businesses have
	multiple activities like different product lines, market segments, areas of business, etc that share some common overheads.
	They should ideally have their own structure to report, whether they are profitable or not. For this purpose, there is an
	alternate structure, called the Chart of Cost Centers.</para>
<sect2>
<title>Cost Center</title>
<para>You can create a tree of Cost Centers to represent your business better. Each Income / Expense entry is also tagged against a
	Cost Center. For example, if you have two types of sales:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Walk-in Sales</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Online Sales</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>You may not have shipping expenses for your walk-in customers, and no shop- rent for your online customers. If you want to get
	the profitability of each of these separately, you should create the two as Cost Centers and mark all sales as either "Walk-in" or
	"Online". Mark your all your purchases in the same way.</para>
<para>Thus when you do your analysis you get a better understanding as to which side of your business is doing better. Since ERPNext
	has an option to add multiple Companies, you can create Cost Centers for each Company and manage it separately.</para>
<para>To setup your Chart of Cost Centers go to:</para>
<programlisting>Accounts > Setup > Chart of Cost Centers</programlisting>
<para>Cost centers help you in one more activity, budgeting.</para>

	target a revenue based on which you would set your expenses. Setting a budget will ensure that your expenses do not get out of hand,

<para>Even if you choose to “ignore” budget overruns, you will get a wealth of information from the “Budget vs Actual” variance
	report.</para>
<note><para>When you set a budget, it has to be set as per Account under the Cost Center. For example if you have a Cost Center

<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Accounts-Fiscal_Year">
<title>Fiscal Year</title>
<para>A fiscal year is also known as a financial year or a budget year. It is used for calculating financial statements in
	businesses and other organisations. The fiscal year may or may not be the same as a calendar year. For tax purposes, companies
	can choose to be calendar-year taxpayers or fiscal-year taxpayers. In many jurisdictions, regulatory laws regarding accounting
	and taxation require such reports once per twelve months. However, it is not mandatory that the period should be a calendar year
	(that is, 1 January to 31 December).</para>
<para>A fiscal year usually starts at the beginning of a quarter, such as April 1, July 1 or October 1. However, most companies'
	fiscal year also coincides with the calendar year, which starts January 1. For the most part, it is simpler and easier that way.
	For some organizations, there are advantages in starting the fiscal year at a different time. For example, businesses that are
	seasonal might start their fiscal year on July 1 or October 1. A business that has most of its income in the fall and most of
	its expenses in the spring might also choose to start its fiscal year on October 1. That way, they know what their income will
	be for that year, and can adjust their expenses to maintain their desired profit margins.</para>

	values are balanced at the end of the recording period. In Payment Reconciliation, the invoices are matched against the payments
	made to the bank. Thus if you have many payments which are not reconciled with their respective invoices, you can use the payment

<para>Step 1: Mention Tax Applicable in the Item master: Item master has tax table where you can list taxes which will be applied on
	it. Tax rate mentioned in the item master gets preference over tax rate entered in the transactions. For example, if you provide tax
	rate for VAT as 10% for item ABC, where for same VAT ledger 12% rate is entered in the Sales Order/Invoice, for item ABC, tax rate
	applied would be 10%, as mentioned in the item master.</para>

	Duty applicable, then you tax master should have all these taxes selected.</para>
<para>Step 3: Set Tax Rate as Zero in Taxes and Charges Master: In the Taxes and Other Charges master, tax rate will be updated as
	ZERO. It means, tax rate applicable on items will be pulled from the respective Item master. While for other items, 0% tax will be
