	At the end of sales and purchase cycle comes billing and payments. You may have an accountant in your team, or you may be doing accounting yourself, or you may have outsourced your accounting. In all the cases financial accounting forms the core of any business management system like an ERP.
	</para>
	<para>
	In ERPNext, your accounting operations consists of 3 main transactions:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>Sales Invoice: The bills that you raise to your Customers for the products or services you provide.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Purchase Invoice: Bills that your Suppliers give you for their products or services.</para>

		<title>Introduction to Accounting</title>
		<para>
		People new to accounting are often confused with the terms Debit and Credit. Contrary to their meaning, these terms have nothing to do with who owes what.
		</para>
		<sect2>
		<title>Debit and Credit</title>
		<para>
		Debit and Credit are conventions. All accounting follows these, so that it is easy to understand the state of finances in a universal manner. These conventions are:
		</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>All Accounts are of type Debit or Credit.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Assets and Expenses (and their sub-groups) are always Debit.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Liabilities and Income (and their sub-groups) are always Credit.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>In all accounting entries, you “debit” an Account or “credit” one.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>When you “debit” a Debit Account (an asset or expense), its value increases (“add” operation). When you “credit” a Debit Account, its value decreases (“subtract” operation). The same rule applies for Credit Accounts. “Crediting” a Credit Account, increases its value, “debiting” it decreases its value.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>All accounting transactions (like a sales or a payment) must affect at least two different Accounts and sum of debits must be equal to sum of credits for the transaction. This is called the “double-entry bookkeeping system”.</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
		<para>
		Still confused? These conventions will become clear as you make transactions.
		</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2>
		<title>Accrual System</title>
		<para>
		Another important concept to understand in Accounting is accrual. This is important when your payment happens separately from delivery.
		</para>
		<para>
		For example, you buy X from a Supplier and your Supplier sends you a bill and expects you to pay in, for example, seven days. Even if you have not yet paid your Supplier, your expense must be booked immediately. This expense is booked against a group of Accounts called “Accounts Payable” that is the sum of all your outstanding dues to your Suppliers. This is called accrual. When you pay your Supplier, you will cancel his dues and update your bank account.
		</para>
		<para>
		ERPNext works on an accrual system. The transactions that accrue income and expense are Sales Invoice and Purchase Invoice.
		</para>
		<para>
		In retail, typically, delivery and payment happens at the same time. To cover this scenario, we have in ERPNext a POS Invoice (POS = Point of Sales). More on that later.
		</para>
		</sect2>
	</sect1>
	<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Accounts-Sales">
		<title>Sales</title>
		<para>
		A Sales Invoice is a bill that you send to your customers, against which the customer processes the payment. Sales Invoice is an accounting transaction. On submission of Sales Invoice, the system updates the receivable and books income against a Customer Account.
		</para>
		<para>
		You can create a Sales Invoice directly from
		</para>
		<programlisting>Accounting > Documents > Sales Invoice > New Sales Invoice
		</programlisting>
		<para>
		or Click on Make Invoice at the right hand corner of the Delivery Note.
		</para>
		<sect2>
		<title>Accounting Impact</title>
		<para>
		All Sales must be booked against an “Income Account”. This refers to an Account in the “Income” section of your Chart of Accounts. It is a good practice to classify your income by type (like product income, service income etc). The Income Account must be set for each row of the Items table.
		</para>
		<note>
		<para>To set default Income Accounts for Items, you can set it in the Item or Item Group.</para>
		</note>
		<para>
		The other account that is affected is the Account of the Customer. That is automatically set from “Debit To” in the heading section.
		</para>
		<para>
		You must also mention the Cost Centers in which your Income must be booked. Remember that your Cost Centers tell you the profitability of the different lines of business or product. You can also set a default Cost Center in the Item master.
		</para>
		<sect3>
		<title>Accounting entries (GL Entry) for a typical double entry “Sale”:</title>
		<para>
		When booking a sale (accrual):
		</para>
		<para>
		Debit: Customer (grand total) Credit: Income (net total, minus taxes for each Item) Credit: Taxes (liabilities to be paid to the government)
		</para>
		<note>
		<para>To see entries in your Sales Invoice after you “Submit”, click on “View Ledger”.</para>
		</note>
		</sect3>
		<sect3>
		<title>Dates</title>
		<para>
		Posting Date: The date on which the Sales Invoice will affect your books of accounts i.e. your General Ledger. This will affect all your balances in that accounting period.
		</para>
		<para>
		Due Date: The date on which the payment is due (if you have sold on credit). This can be automatically set from the Customer master.
		</para>
		</sect3>
		<sect3>
		<title>Recurring Invoices</title>
		<para>
		If you have a contract with a Customer where you bill the Customer on a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annual basis, you can check the “Recurring Invoice” box. Here you can fill in the details of how frequently you want to bill this Invoice and the period for which the contract is valid.
		</para>
		<para>
		ERPNext will automatically create new Invoices and mail it to the email ids you set.
		</para>
		</sect3>
		</sect2>
		<sect2>
		<title>"Pro Forma" Invoice</title>
		<para>
		If you want to give an Invoice to a Customer to make a payment before you deliver, i.e. you operate on a payment first basis, you should create a Quotation and title it as a “Pro-forma Invoice” (or something similar) using the Print Heading feature.
		</para>
		<para>
		“Pro Forma” means for formality. Why do this? Because if you book a Sales Invoice it will show up in your “Accounts Receivable” and “Income”. This is not ideal as your Customer may or may not decide to pay up. But since your Customer wants an “Invoice”, you could give the Customer a Quotation (in ERPNext) titled as “Pro Forma Invoice”. This way everyone is happy.
		</para>
		</sect2>
	</sect1>
	<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Accounts-Purchase">
		<title>Purchase Invoice</title>
		<para>
		Purchase Invoice is the exact opposite of your Sales Invoice. It is the bill that your Supplier sends you for products or services delivered. Here you accrue expenses to your Supplier. Making a Purchase Invoice is very similar to making a Purchase Order.
		</para>
		<para>
		To make a new Purchase Invoice, go to:
		</para>
		<programlisting>Accounts > Documents > Purchase Invoice > New Purchase Invoice
		</programlisting>
		<para>
		or click on “Make Purchase Invoice” in Purchase Order or Purchase Receipt.
		</para>
		<note>
		<para>The concept of “Posting Date” is again same as Sales Invoice. “Bill No” and “Bill Date” helps to track the bill number as set by your Supplier for reference.</para>
		</note>
		<sect2>
		<title>Accounting Impact</title>
		<para>
		Like in Sales Invoice, you have to enter an Expense or an Asset account for each row in your Items table. This helps to indicate if the Item is an Asset or an Expense. You must also enter a Cost Center. These can also be set in the Item master.
		</para>
		<para>
		The Purchase Invoice will affect your accounts as follows:
		</para>
		<para>
		Accounting entries (GL Entry) for a typical double entry “purchase”:
		</para>
		<para>Debits:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Expense or Asset (net totals, excluding taxes)</para>

		To see entries in your Purchase Invoice after you “Submit”, click on “View Ledger”.
		</para>
		<sect3>
		<title>Is purchase an “Expense” or an “Asset”?</title>
		<para>
		If the Item is consumed immediately on purchase, or if it is a service, then the purchase becomes an “Expense”. For example, a telephone bill or travel bill is an “Expense” - it is already consumed.
		</para>
		<para>
		For inventory Items, that have a value, these purchases are not yet “Expense”, because they still have a value while they remain in your stock. They are “Assets”. If they are raw-materials (used in a process), they will become “Expense” the moment they are consumed in the process. If they are to be sold to a Customer, they become “Expense” when you ship them to the Customer.
		</para>
		</sect3>
		<sect3>
		<title>Deducting Taxes at Source</title>
		<para>
		In many countries, the law may require you to deduct taxes, while paying your suppliers. These taxes could be based on a standard rate. Under these type of schemes, typically if a Supplier crosses a certain threshold of payment, and if the type of product is taxable, you may have to deduct some tax (which you pay back to your government, on your Supplier’s behalf).
		</para>
		<para>
		To do this, you will have to make a new Tax Account under “Tax Liabilities” or similar and credit this Account by the percent you are bound to deduct for every transaction.
		</para>
		<important>
		<para>Taxes are an essential part of accounting, if you are miscalculating taxes your business may be at risk of fines and tax charges. If you are unsure about the calculation or application of any tax consult your accountant or tax specialist.</para>

		<title>Reconciling Cheque Payments</title>
		<para>
		If you are receiving payments or making payments via cheques, the bank statements will not accurately match the dates of your entry, this is because the bank usually takes time to “clear” these payments. Also you may have mailed a cheque to your Supplier and it may be a few days before it is received and deposited by the Supplier. In ERPNext you can synchronize your bank statements and your Journal Vouchers using the “Bank Reconciliation” tool.
		</para>
		<para>
		To use this, go to:
		</para>
		<programlisting>Accounts > Tools > Bank Reconciliation
		</programlisting>
		<para>
		Select your “Bank” Account and enter the dates of your statement. Here you will get all the “Bank Voucher” type entries. In each of the entry on the right most column, update the “Clearance Date” and click on “Update”.
		</para>
		<para>
		By doing this you will be able to sync your bank statements and entries into the system.
		</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2>
		<title>Managing Outstanding Payments</title>
		<para>
		In most cases, apart from retail sales, billing and payments are separate activities. There are several combinations in which these payments are done. These cases apply to both sales and purchases.
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>They can be upfront (100% in advance).</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Post shipment. Either on delivery or within a few days of delivery.</para>

			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Advances can be given together for a bunch of invoices (and can be split across invoices).</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>
		ERPNext allows you to manage all these scenarios. All accounting entries (GL Entry) can be made against a Sales Invoice, Purchase Invoice or Journal Vouchers (in special cases, an invoice can be made via a Sales Invoice too).
		</para>
		<para>
		The total outstanding amount against an invoice is the sum of all the accounting entries that are made “against” (or are linked to) that invoice. This way you can combine or split payments in Journal Vouchers to manage the scenarios.
		</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2>
		<title>Matching Payments to Invoices</title>
		<para>
		In complex scenarios, especially in the capital goods industry, sometimes there is no direct link between payments and invoices. You send invoices to your Customers and your Customer sends you block payments or payments based on some schedule that is not linked to your invoices.
		</para>
		<para>
		In such cases, you can use the Payment to Invoice Matching Tool.
		</para>
		<programlisting>Accounts > Tools > Payment Reconciliation
		</programlisting>
		<para>
		In this tool, you can select an account (your Customer’s account) and click on “Pull Payment Entries” and it will select all un-linked Journal Vouchers and Sales Invoices from that Customer.
		</para>
		<para>
		To cancel off some payments and invoices, select the Invoices and Journal Vouchers and click on “Reconcile”.

	<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Accounts-Advance">
		<title>Advance Payment Entry</title>
		<para>
		Payment done by the customer before accepting delivery of the product is an Advance Payment. For Orders of high value, the business houses expect to receive advance.
		</para>
		<para>
		For Example: Consider a customer- Jane D'souza placing an order for a double bed costing Rs 100000/- She is asked to give some advance before the furniture house begins work on her order. She gives them Rs 1000/- in cash.

		Go to Accounts and open a new Journal Voucher to make the advance entry.
		</para>
		<programlisting>Accounts > Documents > Journal Voucher > New Journal Voucher
		</programlisting>
		<para>
		Mention the voucher type as cash voucher. This differs for different customers. If somebody pays by cheque the voucher type will be Bank Voucher. Then select the customer account and make the respective debit and credit entries.
		</para>
		<para>
		Since the customer has given 10000/- as cash advance,it will be recorded as a credit entry against the customer. To balance it with the debit entry[Double accounting Entry]enter 10000/- as debit against the company's cash account. In the row "Is Advance" click 'Yes'.
		</para>
		<sect2>
		<title>Double Entry Accounting</title>
		<para>
		Double entry bookkeeping is a system of accounting in which every transaction has a corresponding positive and negative entry : debits and credits. Every transaction involves a debit entry in one account and a credit entry in another account. This means that every transaction must be recorded in two accounts; one account will be debited because it receives value and the other account will be credited because it has given value.
		</para>
		<para>
		Save and submit the JV. If this document is not saved it will not be pulled in other accounting documents.
		</para>
		<para>
		When you make a new Sales Invoice for the same customer, mention the advance in the Sales Invoice Form.
		</para>
		<para>
		To link the Sales Invoice to the Journal Voucher which mentions the advance payment entry, click on ‘Get Advances Received’. Allocate the amount of advance in the advances table. The accounting will be adjusted accordingly.

				</para>
				<para>
				Opening capital accounts - like your shareholder’s (or owner’) capital, loans, bank balances on that day. List of outstanding sales and purchase invoices (Payables and Receivables).
				</para>
				<para>
				Based on Voucher Type
				</para>
				<para>
				You can select accounts based on the voucher type. In such a scenario, your balance sheet should be balanced.

		Chart of Accounts is a tree view of the names of the Accounts (Ledgers and Groups) that a Company requires to manage its books of accounts. ERPNext sets up a simple chart of accounts for each Company you create, but you have to modify it according to your needs and legal requirements. ￼ For each company, Chart of Accounts signifies the way to classify the accounting entries, mostly based on statutory (tax, compliance to government regulations) requirements.
		</para>
		<sect2>
			<title>Balance Sheet Accounts</title>
			<para>
			The Balance Sheet has Application of Funds (Assets) and Sources of Funds (Liabilities) that signify the net-worth of your company at any given time. When you begin or end a financial period, all the Assets are equal to the Liabilities.
			</para>
			<note>
			<para>If you are new to accounting, you might be wondering, how can Assets be equal to Liabilities? That would mean the company has nothing of its own. Thats right. All the “investment” made in the company to buy assets (like land, furniture, machines) is made by the owners and is a liability to the company. If the company would want to shut down, it would need to sell all the assets and pay back all the liabilities (including profits) to the owners, leaving itself with nothing.</para>
			</note>
			<para>
			All the accounts under this represent an asset owned by the company like "Bank Account", "Land and Property", "Furniture" or a liability (funds that the company owes to others) like "Owners funds", "Debt" etc.
			</para>
			<para>
			Two special accounts to note here are Accounts Receivable (money you have to collect from your customers) and Accounts Payable (money you have to pay to your suppliers) under Assets and Liabilities respectively.
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2>
			<title>Profit and Loss Accounts</title>
			<para>
			Profit and Loss is the group of Income and Expense accounts that represent your accounting transactions over a period.
			</para>
			<para>
			Unlike Balance sheet accounts, Profit and Loss accounts (or PL accounts) do not represent net worth (assets), but rather represent the amount of money spent and collected in servicing customers during the period. Hence at the beginning and end of your Fiscal Year, they become zero.
			</para>
			<note>
			<para>On the first day of the year you have not made any profit or loss, but you still have assets, hence balance sheet accounts never become zero at the beginning or end of a period</para>

			<title>Groups and Ledgers</title>

			There are two main kinds of Accounts in ERPNext - Group and Ledger. Groups can have sub-groups and ledgers within them, whereas ledgers are the leaf nodes of your chart and cannot be further classified.
			</para>
			<para>
			Accounting Transactions can only be made against Ledger Accounts (not Groups)
			</para>

			<para> The term "Ledger" means a page in an accounting book where entries are made. There is usually one ledger for each account (like a Customer or a Supplier).</para>

		<title>Cost Center and Budgeting</title>
		<para>
		Your Chart of Accounts is mainly designed to provide reports to the government and tax authorities. ￼ Most businesses have multiple activities like different product lines, market segments, areas of business, etc that share some common overheads.They should ideally have their own structure to report, whether they are profitable or not. For this purpose, there is an alternate structure, called the Chart of Cost Centers.
		</para>
		<sect2>
			<title>Cost Center</title>
			<para>
			You can create a tree of Cost Centers to represent your business better. Each Income / Expense entry is also tagged against a Cost Center. For example, if you have two types of sales:
			</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Walk-in Sales</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Online Sales</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>
			You may not have shipping expenses for your walk-in customers, and no shop- rent for your online customers. If you want to get the profitability of each of these separately, you should create the two as Cost Centers and mark all sales as either "Walk-in" or "Online". Mark your all your purchases in the same way.
			</para>
			<para>
			Thus when you do your analysis you get a better understanding as to which side of your business is doing better. Since ERPNext has an option to add multiple Companies, you can create Cost Centers for each Company and manage it separately.

			To setup your Chart of Cost Centers go to:

		<title>Fiscal Year</title>
		<para>
		A fiscal year is also known as a financial year or a budget year. It is used for calculating financial statements in businesses and other organisations. The fiscal year may or may not be the same as a calendar year. For tax purposes, companies can choose to be calendar-year taxpayers or fiscal-year taxpayers. In many jurisdictions, regulatory laws regarding accounting and taxation require such reports once per twelve months. However, it is not mandatory that the period should be a calendar year (that is, 1 January to 31 December).
		</para>
		<para>
		A fiscal year usually starts at the beginning of a quarter, such as April 1, July 1 or October 1. However, most companies' fiscal year also coincides with the calendar year, which starts January 1. For the most part, it is simpler and easier that way. For some organizations, there are advantages in starting the fiscal year at a different time. For example, businesses that are seasonal might start their fiscal year on July 1 or October 1. A business that has most of its income in the fall and most of its expenses in the spring might also choose to start its fiscal year on October 1. That way, they know what their income will be for that year, and can adjust their expenses to maintain their desired profit margins.

		Taxes selected in the Tax and Other Charges in transactions are applied on all the items. If you need different taxes applied on items selected in the same transaction, you should setup you item and tax master as explained in the steps below.
		</para>
		<para>
		Step 1: Mention Tax Applicable in the Item master: Item master has tax table where you can list taxes which will be applied on it. Tax rate mentioned in the item master gets preference over tax rate entered in the transactions. For example, if you provide tax rate for VAT as 10% for item ABC, where for same VAT ledger 12% rate is entered in the Sales Order/Invoice, for item ABC, tax rate applied would be 10%, as mentioned in the item master.
		</para>
		<para>
		Step 2: Setup Taxes and Other Charges: In Taxes and Other Charges master, you should select all the applicable taxes which could be applicable on item. For example, if few items has VAT 5 applied on them, other has Service Tax applied, and some other has Excise Duty applicable, then you tax master should have all these taxes selected.
		</para>
		<para>
		Step 3: Set Tax Rate as Zero in Taxes and Charges Master: In the Taxes and Other Charges master, tax rate will be updated as ZERO. It means, tax rate applicable on items will be pulled from the respective Item master. While for other items, 0% tax will be applied, means no other taxes will be applied on that item. Based on the above setting, you will have taxes applied on items as mentioned in the respective item master. Check following for an instance.
