<title>Collaboration Tools</title>
<para>We live in an era when people are very comfortable communicating, discussing, asking, assigning work and getting
	feedback electronically. The Internet acts as a great medium to collaborate on work too. Taking this concept into ERP
	system, we have designed a bunch of tools whereby you can Assign transactions, manage your To Dos, share and maintain
	a Calendar, maintain a company wise Knowledge Base, Tag and Comment on transactions and send your Orders, Invoices etc
	via Email. You can also send instant messages to other users using the Messaging tool.</para>
<para>These tools are integrated into all aspects of the product so that you can effectively manage your data and collaborate
	with your co-workers.</para>
<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Collaboration-ToDo">
<title>To Do</title>
<para>To Do is a simple tool where all the activities assigned to you and assigned by you are listed. You can also add your
	own to-do items in the list.</para>
<para>When task is completed, you should simply remove assignment from the assigned document. With this, task will be removed
	from your Todo list as well. For Todo which are not assigned via document, you can set their status as Closed from the Todo
	record itself.</para>

<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Collaboration-Messages">
<title>Messages</title>

<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Collaboration-Assignment">
<title>Assignmet</title>
<para>Assign To feature in ERPNext allows you to allocate particular document to specific user, whom needs to further work on that
	document. For example, if Sales Order needs to be approved/submitted by Sales Manager, first draft user can allocate that Sales
	Order to Sales Manager. On allocating document to Sales Manager, it will be added to that user's ToDo list. Same way, allocation
	can also be done to Material User and Account user who needs to create Delivery Note and Sales Invoice respectively against this
	Sales Note.</para>
