	<title>Collaboration Tools</title>
	<para>
	We live in an era when people are very comfortable communicating, discussing, asking, assigning work and getting feedback electronically. The Internet acts as a great medium to collaborate on work too. Taking this concept into ERP system, we have designed a bunch of tools whereby you can Assign transactions, manage your To Dos, share and maintain a Calendar, maintain a company wise Knowledge Base, Tag and Comment on transactions and send your Orders, Invoices etc via Email. You can also send instant messages to other users using the Messaging tool.

	These tools are integrated into all aspects of the product so that you can effectively manage your data and collaborate with your co-workers.

		Assign To feature in ERPNext allows you to allocate particular document to specific user, whom needs to further work on that document. For example, if Sales Order needs to be approved/submitted by Sales Manager, first draft user can allocate that Sales Order to Sales Manager. On allocating document to Sales Manager, it will be added to that user's ToDo list. Same way, allocation can also be done to Material User and Account user who needs to create Delivery Note and Sales Invoice respectively against this Sales Note.
