		<title>Basic Concepts</title>
		<para>
			<emphasis role="bold">Company:</emphasis> This represents the Company records for which ERPNext is setup. With this same setup, you can create multiple Company records, each representing a different legal entity. The accounting for each Company will be different, but they will share the Customer, Supplier and Item records
		</para>
		<para>

		</para>

		</para>

		</para>
		<para>
