<title>Selling</title>
<para>Selling is the communication that happens with the customer prior to and during the sale. You might be managing all
	the communication yourself or you may have a small team of sales people to handle this. ERPNext helps you track the
	communication leading up to the sale, by keeping all your documents in an organized and searchable manner.</para>
<para>ERPNext helps you track business Opportunities from Leads and Customers, send them Quotations and make confirmed
	Sales Orders.</para>
<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Selling-Setup">
<title>Selling Setup</title>
<para>This section includes information on how to setup customer groups, sales partners, sales persons and terms and
	conditions. It has instructions on how to configure selling settings, in order to enable default fields.</para>
<sect2 id="sect2-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Selling-Setup-Group">
<title>Customer Group</title>
<para>Customer Group is a category where you specify your customer group type. Your customers can be Individuals or they
	can be corporate(Company) customers. Your customers could also be government officials or non-profit organisations.
	ERPNext allows you to create your own Customer Groups. To create a new Customer Group, go to</para>
<programlisting>Selling > Setup > Customer Group</programlisting>
<para>Customer Group master is maintained in tree strcuture. This allows you to set parent Customer Groups, and Child
	Customer Groups under those Parent Groups. Setting up this structure shall allow you making intelligent sales report
	based on Customer Group master.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect2-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Selling-Setup-Setting">
<title>Selling Settings</title>
<para>Selling Setting is where you can define propertiese which will be applied in your selling transactions. Let's check into
	each property one by one.</para>
<sect3>
<title>Customer Naming By</title>
<para>When customer is saved, system generated unique ID for that Customer. Using that Customer ID, you can select Customer in
	other transactions. Bydefault Customer will be saved with Customer Name. If you wish to save Customer using a naming series,
	you should set Customer Naming By as "Naming Series". You can set Naming Series for customer naming from:</para>
<programlisting>Setup > Settings > Naming Series</programlisting>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>Campaign Naming By</title>
<para>Just like for Customer, you can also configure as how ID will be generated for the Campaign master. Bydefault Campaign
	will be saved with Campaign Name provided while its creation.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>Default Customer Group</title>
<para>Customer Group in this field will be auto-updated when you open new Customer form. While converting Quotation created for
	Lead into Sales Order, system attempts to convert Lead into Customer in the backend. While creating Customer in the backend,
	system pickup Customer Group and Territory as defined in the Selling Setting. If system doesn't find any values, then following
	validation message will be raised.
</para>
<para>To resolve this, you should: Either manually convert Lead into Customer, and define Customer Group and Territory manually
	while creating Customer, or define Default Customer Group and Territory in the Selling Setting. Then you should have Lead
	automatically converted into Customer when convert Quotation into Sales Order.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>Default Territory</title>
<para>Territory defined in this field will be auto-updated in the Territory field of Customer master. Just like Customer Group,
	Territory is also checked when system tries creating Customer in the backend.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>Sales Order Required</title>
<para>If you wish to make Sales Order creation mandatory before creation of Sales Invoice, then you should set Sales Order Required
	field as Yes. Bydefault, this will be "No" for a value.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title> Delivery Note Required</title>
<para>To make Delivery Note creation as mandatory before Sales Invoice creation, you should set this field as "Yes". It will be "No"
	by default.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title> Default Price List</title>
<para>Price List set in this field will be auto-updated in the Price List field of Sales transactions.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title> Maintain Same Rate Throughout Sales Cycle</title>
<para>System bydefault validates that item price will be same throughout sales cycle (Sales Order - Delivery Note - Sales Invoice).
	If you could have item price changing within the cycle, and you need to bypass validation of same rate throughout cycle, then you
	should uncheck this field and save.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title> Allow User to Edit Price List Rate in Transaction</title>
<para>Item table of the sale transactions has field called Price List Rate. This field be non-editale by default in all the sales
	transactions. This is to ensure that price of an item is fetched from Item Price record, and user is not able to edit it. If you
	need to enable user to edit Item Price, fetched from Price List of an item, you should uncheck this field.</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Selling-Master">
<title>Customer Master</title>
<para>A customer, who is sometimes known as a client, buyer, or purchaser is the one who receives goods, services, products, or ideas,
	from a seller for a monetary consideration. A customer can also receive goods or services from a vendor or a supplier for other
	valuable considerations. You can either directly create your Customers via</para>
<programlisting>Selling > Customer</programlisting>
<para>or upload it via the Data Import Tool.</para>
<note><para>Customers are separate from Contacts and Addresses. A Customer can have multiple Contacts and Addresses.</para></note>
<sect2>
<title>Contacts and Addresses</title>
<para>Contacts and Addresses in ERPNext are stored separately so that you can attach multiple Contacts or Addresses to Customers
	and Suppliers. To add a Contact or Address directly from the Customer record, click on “New Contact” or “New Address”.</para>
<note><para>When you select a Customer in any transaction, one Contact and Address gets pre-selected. This is the “Default Contact
	or Address”.</para></note>
<para>To Import multiple Contacts and Addresses from a spreadsheet, use the Data Import Tool.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Integration with Accounts</title>
<para>In ERPNext, there is a separate Account record for each Customer, for each Company. When you create a new Customer, ERPNext
	will automatically create an Account Ledger for the Customer under “Accounts Receivable” in the Company set in the Customer
	record.</para>
<important><para> If you want to change the Account Group under which the Customer Account is created, you can set it in the Company
	master.</para></important>
<para>If you want to create an Account in another Company, just change the Company value and “Save” the Customer again.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Customer Settings</title>
<para>You can link a Price List to a Customer (select “Default Price List”), so that when you select that Customer, the Price List
	will be automatically selected. You can set “Credit Days” so that it is automatically set in the Sales Invoices made against this
	Customer. You can set how much credit you want to allow for a Customer by adding the “Credit Limit”. You can also set a global
	“Credit Limit” in the Company master. ERPNext allows you to group your Customers and also divide them into Territories. Grouping
	will help you get better analysis of your data and identify which Customers are profitable and which are not. Territories will help
	you set sales targets for the respective territories.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Customer Group</title>
<para>You can group your Customers so that you can get trend analysis for each group. Typically Customers are grouped by market
	segment (that is usually based on your domain).</para>
<note><para> If you think all this is too much effort, you can leave it at “Default Customer Group”. But all this effort, will pay
	off when you start getting reports.</para></note>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Territory</title>
<para>If your business operates in multiple Territories (could be countries, states or cities) it is usually a great idea to build
	your structure in the system. Once you group your Customers by Territories, you can set annual targets for each Item Group and get
	reports that will show your actual performance in the territory v/s what you had planned.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Sales Person</title>
<para>Sales Persons behave exactly like Territories. You can create an organization chart of Sales Persons where each Sales Person’s
	target can be set individually. Again as in Territory, the target has to be set against Item Group.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Sales Partner</title>
<para>A Sales Partner is a third party distributor / dealer / commission agent / affiliate / reseller who sells the companies products,
	for a commission. This is useful if you make the end sale to the Customer, involving your Sales Partner. If you sell to your Sales
	Partner who in-turn sells it to the Customer, then you must make a Customer instead.</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Selling-Discount">
<title>Discount</title>
<para>While making your sales transactions like a Quotation (or Sales Order) you would already have noticed that there is a “Discount”
	column. On the left is the “Price List Rate” on the right is the “Basic Rate”. You can add a “Discount” value to update the basic
	rate.</para>
<para>Since your taxes are calculated on Items, you must apply your discounts here so that you apply the tax on the discounted rate,
	which is the case for most taxes.</para>
<para>The second way to apply discount is to add it in your Taxes and Charges table. This way you can explicitly show the Customer
	the discount you have applied on the order. If you choose this method, remember that you will tax your Customer at the full rate,
	not the discounted rate. So this is not a good way to track discounts.</para>
<para>There is a third way to do it. Create an Item called “Discount” and make sure that all the taxes apply in the same way as the
	main Items. (This method is useful if only one type of tax is applicable on the sale). This way your “Discount” will appear as an
	expense. You will see a slightly higher income and expense but your profits will still remain the same. This method might be
	interesting where you want detailed accounting of your discounts.</para>
<note><para>The maximum Discount that can be applied on an Item can be fixed in the Item master.</para></note>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Selling-Lead">
<title>Lead</title>
<para>To get the customer through the door, you may be doing all or any of the following:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Listing your product on directories.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Maintaining an updated and searchable website.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Meeting people at trade events.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Advertising your product or services.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>When you send out the word that you are around and have something valuable to offer, people will come in to check out your
	product. These are your Leads.</para>
<para>They are called Leads because they may lead you to a sale. Sales people usually work on leads by calling them, building a
	relationship and sending information about their products or services. It is important to track all this conversation to enable
	another person who may have to follow-up on that contact. The new person is then able to know the history of that particular Lead.
	To create a Lead, go to:</para>
<programlisting>Selling > Lead > New Lead</programlisting>
<para>ERPNext gives you a lot of options you may want to store about your Leads. For example what is the source, how likely are they
	to give you business etc. If you have a healthy number of leads, this information will help you prioritize who you want to work
	with.</para>
<note><para>ERPNext makes it easy to follow-up on leads by updating the “Next Contact” details. This will add a new event in the
	Calendar for the User who has to contact the lead next.</para></note>
<sect2>
<title>Difference between Lead, Contact and Customer</title>
<para>The difference is that a Lead is a potential Customer, someone who can give you business. A Customer is an organization or
	individual who has given you business before (and has an Account in your system). A Contact is a person who belongs to the
	Customer.</para>
			<para>
			A Lead can be converted to a Customer by clicking on the “Create Customer” button. Once the Customer is created, the Lead becomes “Converted” and any further Opportunities from the same source can be created against the Customer.
			</para>
		</sect2>
	</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Selling-Opportunity">
<title>Opportunity</title>
<para>When you know a Lead is looking for some products or services to buy, you can track that as an Opportunity. You can create
	an Opportunity from:</para>
<programlisting>Selling > Opportunity > New Opportunity</programlisting>
<para>You can also open a “Open” Lead and click on “Create Opportunity” button.</para>
<para>An Opportunity can also come from an existing Customer. You can create multiple Opportunities against the same Lead. In
	Opportunity, apart from the Communication, you can also add the Items for which the Lead or Contact is looking for.</para>
<important><para>Leads and Opportunities are often referred as your “Sales Pipeline” this is what you need to track if you want to
	be able to predict how much business you are going to get in the future. Its always a good idea to be able to track what is coming
	in order to adjust your resources.</para></important>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Selling-Quotation">
<title>Quotation</title>
<para>During a sale, the customer may request for a written note about the products or services you are planning to offer, along
	with the prices and other terms of engagement. This is called a “Proposal” or an “Estimate” or a “Pro Forma Invoice”or a Quotation.
	To create a new Quotation go to:</para>
<programlisting>Selling > Quotation > New Quotation</programlisting>
<para>A Quotation contains details about:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The recipient of the Quotation.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The Items and quantities you are offering.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The rates at which they are offered. For details refer.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The taxes applicable.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Other charges (like shipping, insurance) if applicable.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The validity of contract.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The time of delivery.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Other conditions.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<note><para>Images look great on Quotations. To add images to your Quotations, attach the corresponding image in the Item
	master.</para></note>
<sect2>
<title>Rates</title>
<para>The rates you quote may depend on two things.</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The Price List: If you have multiple Price Lists, you can select a Price List or tag it to the Customer (so
	that it is auto-selected). Your Item prices will automatically be updated from the Price List.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The Currency: If you are quoting to a Customer in a different currency, you will have to update the conversion
	rates to enable ERPNext to save the information in your standard Currency. This will help you to analyze the value of your
	Quotations in standard Currency.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Taxes</title>
<para>To add taxes to your Quotation, you can either select a tax template, Sales Taxes and Charges Master or add the taxes on
	your own. You can add taxes in the same manner as the Sales Taxes and Charges Master.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Terms and Conditions</title>
<para>Each Quotation must ideally contain a set of terms, of your contract. It is usually a good idea to make templates of your
	Terms and Conditions, so that you have a standard set of terms. You can do this by going to:</para>
<programlisting>Selling > Terms and Conditions</programlisting>
</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect1-ERPNext-Manual_ERPNext-Selling-Sales_Order">
<title>Sales Order</title>
<para>
The Sales Order confirms your sales and triggers purchase (Material Request) shipment (Delivery Note), billing (Sales Invoice) and
manufacturing (Production Plan). A Sales Order is usually a binding Contract with your Customer. Once your customer confirms the
Quotation you can convert your Quotation into a Sales Order.</para>
<para>Alternatively, you can create a Sales Order directly from:</para>
<programlisting>Selling > Sales Order > New Sales Order</programlisting>
<sect2>
<title>Next Steps</title>
<para>Once you “Submit” your Sales Order, you can now trigger different aspects of your organization:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>To begin purchase click on “Make Purchase Request”</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>To make a shipment entry click on “Make Delivery Note”</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>To bill, make “Make Sales Invoice”</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>To stop further process on this Sales Order, click on “Stop”</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Submission</title>
<para>Sales Order is a “Submittable” transaction. See Document Stages. You will be able to execute dependent steps (like making a
	Delivery Note) only after “Submitting” this Sales Order.</para>
