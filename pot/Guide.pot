msgid "There are three standard workflows for order fulfillment. These guides explains step by step taking an example case how to execute these in ERPNext."
msgstr ""

msgid "Engineer To Order: Products are designed as per customer's requirements and manufactured once the contract is completed. Examples: Construction, Furniture, Capital Goods etc."
msgstr ""

msgid "Make To Order: Products are fixed, but fulfillment (manufacutring / procurement) only starts after receipt of order: Light Engineering, Machinery, Furniture etc."
msgstr ""

msgid "Make To Stock: Products are fixed and usually available in stock and are shipped as soon as order is received. Examples: Consumer Goods, Retail etc."
msgstr ""

msgid "Test Instance"
msgstr ""

msgid "It is highly recommended to have a test instance in which to practice before going to a request for production."
msgstr ""

msgid "We recommend completing the test cycles as it deems necessary in this instance to do so before the final implementation of the system. You can even have two running instances for testing before working with actual operating data."
msgstr ""

msgid "Engineer To Order"
msgstr ""

msgid "This guide explains how a manufacturing unit would run its operations based on an engineer-to-order type of workflow. In engineer to order companies, a deal goes through multiple stages of discussions going back and forth. At each stage, new proposals are made and new costing for the product is prepared. For this study, a furniture making company, Supreme Furniture, is used as a case-example."
msgstr ""

msgid "Supreme Furniture deals in all-types of furniture. They have a small showroom, where they keep some samples. However, they produce only after a Customer confirms the order and gives their specifications clearly."
msgstr ""

msgid "Production Orders are issued based on customised order obtained after multiple iterations and may change even after production begins."
msgstr ""

msgid "To explain the production cycle we will consider an example of a custom-made bed cum wardrobe for a child. Please read the Overview section to get a glimpse of all the steps required to complete an engineer-to-order cycle."

msgid "Setting Up"
msgstr ""

msgid "In an engineer-to-order system, the products are manufactured based on the client's product requirements followed by their Sales Order. To begin this order cycle, it is essential to create an Item master along with raw materials and sub assemblies, Warehouse, Customers, and Suppliers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Customer"
msgstr ""

msgid "Selling &gt; Customer &gt; New Customer"
msgstr ""

msgid "A Customer, who is sometimes known as a client, buyer, or purchaser is the one who receives goods, services, products, or ideas, from a seller for a monetary consideration. A Customer can also receive goods or services from a vendor or a Supplier for other valuable considerations. In this case-example, the Customer is Ms. Jane Dsouza. She is keen on making a multipurpose bed for her daughter."
msgstr ""

msgid "After setting up the Customer name in the system, it is time to create an Item based on the requirement of the Customer. In this example, the Customer Ms. Jane Dsouza wants a baby bed with a wardrobe attached to it. Thus, create an Item, and the possible raw materials that will go into its making."
msgstr ""

msgid "Item"
msgstr ""

msgid "An Item is your company's product or a service. The term Item is applicable to your core products as well as your raw materials. It can be a product or service that you buy/sell from your Customers/Suppliers. ERPNext allows you to manage all sorts of Items like raw-materials, sub-assemblies, finished goods, Item variants and service Items."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stock &gt; Item &gt; New Item"
msgstr ""

msgid "Make Items for all the raw materials that will go into the final product. Let us call the final product as Child Bed Baby. The raw materials required will be wood, plywood, fevicol, hinges, nails, beadings, slotted angles, foam, wooden panels, sponge, coir, paint etc. The raw materials will also be created as Items. However, their Item Group will be raw materials."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can store milestones as Items. For example, the baby-bed cum wardrobe custom order requires one bed, one wardrobe and 5 drawers. So the Item-milestones can be bed, wardrobe and drawers individually. The final product will be a result of assembling these milestone Item"
msgstr ""

msgid "Item Codification"
msgstr ""

msgid "Item Codification helps in keeping a count of long and and complicated names. It is preferred if you have lots of products"
msgstr ""

msgid "In this example, lets make Bbed-1 as one product milestone, Bwardrobe-1 as another and Bdrawer-1 as the last milestone product. Note that B stands for the Baby range, then comes the name of the Item along with the order no in this category. The product is codified so that there is no confusion with other orders. The completed and assembled Item will be ‘Child Bed Baby’."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sub-assembly"
msgstr ""

msgid "An assembled unit forming a component to be incorporated into a larger assembly is known as a Sub-assembly. To produce an Item , you require a lot of raw-materials. These raw-materials themselves have to be manufactured in some cases. Thus, along with standard raw materials, there is a requirement of raw materials with their own Bill of Materials. These raw materials have their own BOM’s and are called sub-assemblies."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that for milestone Items like Bwardrobe1, Bbed1 and Bdrawers1:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Allow BOM’ field should be marked as 'Yes'. They should be grouped as raw materials, since these will be produced in-house and will go into the making of the final product. The Item milestones are the sub-assemblies."
msgstr ""

msgid "‘Allow Production Order’ should be marked as 'No'. All sub-assemblies will follow the one Production Order raised for the main product Child Bed Baby."
msgstr ""

msgid "In this example Child Bed Baby is the final product, the Bbed1, Bwardrobe1 and Bdrawers1 are sub-assemblies."
msgstr ""

msgid "Warehouse"
msgstr ""

msgid "A Warehouse is a commercial building for storage of goods. Warehouses are used by manufacturers, importers, exporters, wholesalers, transport businesses, customs, etc. They are usually large plain buildings in industrial areas of cities, towns, and villages. They usually have loading docks to load and unload goods from trucks."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setup &gt; Warehouse"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a mandatory field. No Item form will be saved without a Warehouse master. In E-T-O type of company, create one Warehouse for Work-In-Progress and one for Finished Goods."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Warehouses should be under the 'Stock-Expenses' category. Here the goods will be under the parent group 'Stock-Expenses'. Assign these Warehouses to Items accordingly. Select Stock-Expenses under parent group section in the system. You will have to create this new Warehouses in the system. The existing work-in-progress and finished goods Warehouses are by default categorised under 'Assets' by the system. For E-T-O transactions, the finished goods will come under the expense category. Thus, create new Warehouses under Stock-Expenses category."
msgstr ""

msgid "In reality you may not have three Warehouses. You may have only one, which you use for raw material, for manufacturing/stitching/producing and also for storing finished goods. In this case, you have to only imagine separate spaces for each activity, and name them accordingly. For system entry purpose, having three different Warehouses for stocking raw materials, manufacturing unfinished goods and storing finished goods is a necessity."

msgid "Bill of Material"
msgstr ""

msgid "A Bill of Material (BOM) is a list of the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components, parts and the quantities of each needed to manufacture an end product. Make separate Bill of Material for every milestone order. Make one for the final order. Every BOM will have one Operations section and one Materials section. Mention the steps and hourly rates in the Operations section and the quantity of materials required in the Materials section."

msgid "Save and submit all BOM's. Based on the client feedback give a proposal to the client in the form of Quotations. You may have to propose different quotes till the client agrees."
msgstr ""

msgid "Proposal Phase"

msgid "In the proposal phase a client is offered various Quotations for a customised product. The Quotations are amended and adjusted as per the client's need. These Quotations serve as a basis for raising a proforma invoice or for accepting advance payment."
msgstr ""

msgid "Quotation"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the initial quote that is presented to the Customer, for approval of design and the cost of the product."
msgstr ""

msgid "Selling &gt; Quotation &gt; New Quotation"
msgstr ""

msgid "The first Quotation is given to the client, Jane D’souza. She visits a few more custom furniture makers and takes Quotations from them. She realises that there is a scope of margin to negotiate. So she comes back and asks for another Quotation. The showroom supervisor gives her a second quote. He says he can give her the same product, but instead of special plywood, he will use the standard plywood. He assures her that the local plywood maker is very reliable. He also assures her that most clients prefer this plywood since it brings down the total cost and is good in quality."
msgstr ""

msgid "The sales engineer then revises the bill of materials and prepares a new Quotation. It is possible to delete/cancel the existing submitted Quotation and amend it. Mention the new rate with the new design description."
msgstr ""

msgid "In order to print your Quotation as Proforma Invoice, go to print heading in the Quotation’s info section. Select Proforma Invoice as your new print heading and save. The printout will have a heading as Pro-forma Invoice."
msgstr ""

msgid "Proforma Invoice"
msgstr ""

msgid "With the heading as Proforma Invoice, you can bill the client in phases. A Proforma Invoice is a document that is sent to a buyer in certain circumstances - usually before all of the invoice details are known. A Proforma Invoice is not a true invoice – it is simply a document that declares the seller’s commitment to provide the goods or services specified to the buyer at certain prices."
msgstr ""

msgid "Proforma invoices are not recorded as an accounts receivable by the seller nor are they recorded as an accounts payable by the buyer. To print the name Proforma Invoice on the Quotation, create a Print Heading in the system."
msgstr ""

msgid "After creating the print heading, go to the Quotation and change the print heading name. Then, send it to the Customer."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Customer, Jane, realises that if she wants a further decrease in price, the furniture maker will offer further non-branded raw material and decrease cost. She doesn't want to compromise on quality and thus agrees to the second quote. She confirms the order and pays them Rs. 10000/- as Advance. Advance payment is seen as an order confirmation. Based on the confirmation, create a Sales Order."

msgid "Sales Order"
msgstr ""

msgid "A Sales Order is an order issued by a business to a Customer for products and/or services. After the proposal phase, it is time for the organisation to make a Sales Order. Based on the price agreement in the Quotation, make a Sales Order for the custom product 'Child Bed Baby'."

msgid "Accounts &gt; Journal Voucher &gt; New Journal Voucher"
msgstr ""

msgid "Payment done by the Customer before accepting delivery of the product is an Advance Payment. This is done to confirm the order and is paid as token to start manufacturing the product. For orders of high value, the business houses expect to receive advance. Thus, open a new Journal Voucher and make the advance entry."
msgstr ""

msgid "Since the Customer has given 10000/- as cash advance, it will be recorded as a credit entry against the Customer. To balance it with the debit entry (Double Entry Accounting) enter 10000/- as debit against the Company’s cash account."
