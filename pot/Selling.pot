msgid "Selling Setting is where you can define propertiese which will be applied in your selling transactions. Let's check into each property one by one."
msgstr ""

msgid "Customer Naming By"
msgstr ""

msgid "When customer is saved, system generated unique ID for that Customer. Using that Customer ID, you can select Customer in other transactions. Bydefault Customer will be saved with Customer Name. If you wish to save Customer using a naming series, you should set Customer Naming By as \"Naming Series\". You can set Naming Series for customer naming from:"

msgid "Just like for Customer, you can also configure as how ID will be generated for the Campaign master. Bydefault Campaign will be saved with Campaign Name provided while its creation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Default Customer Group"
msgstr ""

msgid "Customer Group in this field will be auto-updated when you open new Customer form. While converting Quotation created for Lead into Sales Order, system attempts to convert Lead into Customer in the backend. While creating Customer in the backend, system pickup Customer Group and Territory as defined in the Selling Setting. If system doesn't find any values, then following validation message will be raised."
msgstr ""

msgid "To resolve this, you should: Either manually convert Lead into Customer, and define Customer Group and Territory manually while creating Customer, or define Default Customer Group and Territory in the Selling Setting. Then you should have Lead automatically converted into Customer when convert Quotation into Sales Order."
msgstr ""

msgid "Default Territory"
msgstr ""

msgid "Territory defined in this field will be auto-updated in the Territory field of Customer master. Just like Customer Group, Territory is also checked when system tries creating Customer in the backend."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sales Order Required"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you wish to make Sales Order creation mandatory before creation of Sales Invoice, then you should set Sales Order Required field as Yes. Bydefault, this will be \"No\" for a value."

msgid "Delivery Note Required"
msgstr ""

msgid "To make Delivery Note creation as mandatory before Sales Invoice creation, you should set this field as \"Yes\". It will be \"No\" by default."

msgid "Default Price List"
msgstr ""

msgid "Price List set in this field will be auto-updated in the Price List field of Sales transactions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Maintain Same Rate Throughout Sales Cycle"
msgstr ""

msgid "System bydefault validates that item price will be same throughout sales cycle (Sales Order - Delivery Note - Sales Invoice). If you could have item price changing within the cycle, and you need to bypass validation of same rate throughout cycle, then you should uncheck this field and save."
msgstr ""

msgid "Allow User to Edit Price List Rate in Transaction"
msgstr ""

msgid "Item table of the sale transactions has field called Price List Rate. This field be non-editale by default in all the sales transactions. This is to ensure that price of an item is fetched from Item Price record, and user is not able to edit it.

msgstr ""

msgid "Customer Master"
msgstr ""

msgid "A customer, who is sometimes known as a client, buyer, or purchaser is the one who receives goods, services, products, or ideas, from a seller for a monetary consideration.

msgid "or upload it via the Data Import Tool."
msgstr ""

msgid "Customers are separate from Contacts and Addresses. A Customer can have multiple Contacts and Addresses."
msgstr ""

msgid "Contacts and Addresses"
msgstr ""

msgid "Contacts and Addresses in ERPNext are stored separately so that you can attach multiple Contacts or Addresses to Customers and Suppliers. To add a Contact or Address directly from the Customer record, click on “New Contact” or “New Address”."
msgstr ""

msgid "When you select a Customer in any transaction, one Contact and Address gets pre-selected. This is the “Default Contact or Address”."
msgstr ""

msgid "To Import multiple Contacts and Addresses from a spreadsheet, use the Data Import Tool."
msgstr ""

msgid "Integration with Accounts"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "If you want to change the Account Group under which the Customer Account is created, you can set it in the Company master."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you want to create an Account in another Company, just change the Company value and “Save” the Customer again."
msgstr ""

msgid "Customer Settings"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can link a Price List to a Customer (select “Default Price List”), so that when you select that Customer, the Price List will be automatically selected. You can set “Credit Days” so that it is automatically set in the Sales Invoices made against this Customer. You can set how much credit you want to allow for a Customer by adding the “Credit Limit”. You can also set a global “Credit Limit” in the Company master. ERPNext allows you to group your Customers and also divide them into Territories. Grouping will help you get better analysis of your data and identify which Customers are profitable and which are not. Territories will help you set sales targets for the respective territories."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can group your Customers so that you can get trend analysis for each group. Typically Customers are grouped by market segment (that is usually based on your domain)."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you think all this is too much effort, you can leave it at “Default Customer Group”. But all this effort, will pay off when you start getting reports."
msgstr ""

msgid "Territory"
msgstr ""

msgid "If your business operates in multiple Territories (could be countries, states or cities) it is usually a great idea to build your structure in the system. Once you group your Customers by Territories, you can set annual targets for each Item Group and get reports that will show your actual performance in the territory v/s what you had planned."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sales Person"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sales Persons behave exactly like Territories. You can create an organization chart of Sales Persons where each Sales Person’s target can be set individually. Again as in Territory, the target has to be set against Item Group."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sales Partner"
msgstr ""

msgid "A Sales Partner is a third party distributor / dealer / commission agent / affiliate / reseller who sells the companies products, for a commission. This is useful if you make the end sale to the Customer, involving your Sales Partner. If you sell to your Sales Partner who in-turn sells it to the Customer, then you must make a Customer instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Discount"
msgstr ""

msgid "While making your sales transactions like a Quotation (or Sales Order) you would already have noticed that there is a “Discount” column. On the left is the “Price List Rate” on the right is the “Basic Rate”. You can add a “Discount” value to update the basic rate."
msgstr ""

msgid "Since your taxes are calculated on Items, you must apply your discounts here so that you apply the tax on the discounted rate, which is the case for most taxes."
msgstr ""

msgid "The second way to apply discount is to add it in your Taxes and Charges table. This way you can explicitly show the Customer the discount you have applied on the order. If you choose this method, remember that you will tax your Customer at the full rate, not the discounted rate. So this is not a good way to track discounts."
msgstr ""

msgid "There is a third way to do it. Create an Item called “Discount” and make sure that all the taxes apply in the same way as the main Items. (This method is useful if only one type of tax is applicable on the sale). This way your “Discount” will appear as an expense. You will see a slightly higher income and expense but your profits will still remain the same. This method might be interesting where you want detailed accounting of your discounts."
msgstr ""

msgid "The maximum Discount that can be applied on an Item can be fixed in the Item master."
msgstr ""

msgid "Lead"
msgstr ""

msgid "To get the customer through the door, you may be doing all or any of the following:"

msgid "Meeting people at trade events."
msgstr ""

msgid "Advertising your product or services."
msgstr ""

msgid "When you send out the word that you are around and have something valuable to offer, people will come in to check out your product. These are your Leads."
msgstr ""

msgid "They are called Leads because they may lead you to a sale. Sales people usually work on leads by calling them, building a relationship and sending information about their products or services. It is important to track all this conversation to enable another person who may have to follow-up on that contact. The new person is then able to know the history of that particular Lead. To create a Lead, go to:"

msgid "Selling &gt; Lead &gt; New Lead"
msgstr ""

msgid "ERPNext gives you a lot of options you may want to store about your Leads. For example what is the source, how likely are they to give you business etc. If you have a healthy number of leads, this information will help you prioritize who you want to work with."
msgstr ""

msgid "ERPNext makes it easy to follow-up on leads by updating the “Next Contact” details. This will add a new event in the Calendar for the User who has to contact the lead next."
msgstr ""

msgid "Difference between Lead, Contact and Customer"
msgstr ""

msgid "The difference is that a Lead is a potential Customer, someone who can give you business. A Customer is an organization or individual who has given you business before (and has an Account in your system). A Contact is a person who belongs to the Customer."
msgstr ""

msgid "A Lead can be converted to a Customer by clicking on the “Create Customer” button. Once the Customer is created, the Lead becomes “Converted” and any further Opportunities from the same source can be created against the Customer."
msgstr ""

msgid "Opportunity"

msgstr ""

msgid "Leads and Opportunities are often referred as your “Sales Pipeline” this is what you need to track if you want to be able to predict how much business you are going to get in the future. Its always a good idea to be able to track what is coming in order to adjust your resources."
msgstr ""

msgid "Quotation"
msgstr ""

msgid "During a sale, the customer may request for a written note about the products or services you are planning to offer, along with the prices and other terms of engagement. This is called a “Proposal” or an “Estimate” or a “Pro Forma Invoice”or a Quotation. To create a new Quotation go to:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Selling &gt; Quotation &gt; New Quotation"
msgstr ""

msgid "A Quotation contains details about:"

msgid "Rates"
msgstr ""

msgid "The rates you quote may depend on two things."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Price List: If you have multiple Price Lists, you can select a Price List or tag it to the Customer (so that it is auto-selected). Your Item prices will automatically be updated from the Price List."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Currency: If you are quoting to a Customer in a different currency, you will have to update the conversion rates to enable ERPNext to save the information in your standard Currency. This will help you to analyze the value of your Quotations in standard Currency."
msgstr ""

msgid "Taxes"
msgstr ""

msgid "To add taxes to your Quotation, you can either select a tax template, Sales Taxes and Charges Master or add the taxes on your own. You can add taxes in the same manner as the Sales Taxes and Charges Master."
msgstr ""

msgid "Terms and Conditions"
msgstr ""

msgid "Each Quotation must ideally contain a set of terms, of your contract. It is usually a good idea to make templates of your Terms and Conditions, so that you have a standard set of terms. You can do this by going to:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Selling &gt; Terms and Conditions"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sales Order"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Sales Order confirms your sales and triggers purchase (Material Request) shipment (Delivery Note), billing (Sales Invoice) and manufacturing (Production Plan). A Sales Order is usually a binding Contract with your Customer. Once your customer confirms the Quotation you can convert your Quotation into a Sales Order."
