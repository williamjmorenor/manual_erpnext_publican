msgid "Setting Up Taxes"
msgstr ""

msgid "One of the primary motivator for compulsory use of accounting tools is calculation of Taxes. You may or may not make money but your government will (to help your country be safe and prosperous). And if you don’t calculate your taxes correctly, they get very unhappy. Ok, philosophy aside, ERPNext allows you to make configurable tax templates that you can apply to your sales or purchase."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tax Accounts: For Tax Accounts that you want to use in the tax templates, you must go to Chart of Accounts and mention them as type “Tax” in your Chart of Item."
msgstr ""

msgid "Item Tax: If some of your Items require different tax rates as compared to others, mention them in the Item tax table. Even if you have selected your sales and purchase taxes as default tax rates, the system will pull the Item tax rate for calculations. Item tax will get preference over other sales or purchase taxes. However, if you wish to apply default sales and purchase taxes, do not mention item tax rates in the Item master. The system will then select the sales or purchase tax rate specified by you as default rates."
